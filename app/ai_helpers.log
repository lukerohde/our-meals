Please read my disclosure policy.\nDelicious Japanese\xa0chicken curry recipe for a weeknight dinner! Tender pieces of chicken, carrots, and potatoes cooked in a rich, savory curry\xa0sauce, this Japanese version of curry is a must-have for your family meal.\xa0\n\nThis may come as a surprise, but Japanese Curry,\xa0aka Curry Rice (Kare Raisu, カレーライス), is an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan. I grew up on curry rice, as my mom would make it as frequently as I can recall. \nThe bite-sized chunks of meat, the thick-cut vegetables, the rich and creamy brown curry sauce, and the fluffy rice make every bite so comforting and exciting. Not only is it a meal that’s easy to make on busy nights, but it also tastes better on the second day. \nSo, if you wish to master Japanese home cooking, you must add Japanese curry to your repertoire. Let me show you how to make Japanese Chicken Curry (チキンカレー) today!\nTable of contentsWhat is Japanese Curry?Homemade Japanese Curry RouxSecret Ingredients – Personalize Your CurryMake Japanese Curry in a Pressure CookerWhat to Serve with Japanese CurryMore Delicious Japanese Curry Recipes\n\nWhat is Japanese Curry? \nJapanese curry is a thick curry with a stew-like consistency and commonly includes protein, sweet onions, carrots, and potatoes. The sauce is thickened by a roux (a mixture of fat and flour and an addition of curry spices). \nYou can find many variations of Japanese curries, ranging from regions to households, but the most basic one uses chicken, which is the recipe I’m sharing here. \nDon’t miss my Japanese curry recipes roundup, which includes vegetarian curry and more!\nHistory of Japanese Curry\nCurry was introduced to Japan in the late 1800s by the British, and they were initially Western-style stews mixed with curry powder. The Japanese adapted curry to their own version, and ‘Curry Rice’ (Kare Raisu, カレーライス) was born soon after. By the 1950s, S&B Foods developed a convenient instant mix — known as curry roux — in block form so everyone could make curry rice easily at home.\nToday, curry has become a staple of the Japanese home and is widely available in restaurants and food halls in departmental stores. The popularity extends beyond Japan; you can find its presence in many other Asian countries. \nWhat Makes Japanese Curry Different from Other Curries\nJapanese curry is quite different from most other curries worldwide\xa0— it has a thicker consistency, and the taste leans on the sweet and savory side. The unique sweetness comes from onions, carrots, and other additions like honey and grated apples. \nThe sauce resembles a rich, thick demi-glace layered with spices and earthy flavors. Some would describe Japanese curry more like a hearty stew than a typical curry like Thai or Indian. It isn’t spicy, so it is suitable for children.\nIt’s also served with Japanese short-grain rice, which is sticker than basmati rice or long-grain rice. The rice grains also soak up the curry. \n\nThe Base Flavor – Japanese Curry Roux\nThe reason why we can make Japanese curry in a short time is that we use the convenient Japanese Curry Sauce Mix (curry roux カレールー) that comes in a box. The curry roux imparts a unique depth of aromatic spice flavor and creaminess to the dish. I’m not a big fan of “instant” or boxed food, but I have to say Japanese Curry Roux is an exception!\n\nSpice Level\nEach brand of curry roux usually comes with three levels of spiciness — Mild, Medium, or Hot. Since these are packaged for Japanese taste, the hot level is not nearly as spicy as Thai or Indian curry.\nToo Salty?\nSome of you may find the pre-boxed curry roux salty, and I agree. It does have a strong (salty) taste, which is why it goes well with plain steamed rice. The Japanese palate, in general, is gravitated to salty, savory foods. \nHere are my suggestions:\n\nMake my homemade curry roux.\nUse water or half water half chicken stock instead of all chicken stock (because the saltiness of the stock varies).\nUse less curry roux.\nAdd more water to dilute the roux, but note that the curry sauce will be more watery.\n\n\nHomemade Japanese Curry Roux\nAlthough the boxed stuff may spare you some time in the kitchen, you’ll be surprised at how easy it is to make your own Japanese Curry Roux at home. And just like all curries, curry roux is best made from scratch. What are the other good reasons for homemade roux?\n\nNo MSG, artificial flavors, or other food additives are commonly found in boxed mixes.\nYou can customize the flavor, spice level, salt level, and thickness.\nYou can also make it gluten-free or vegetarian/vegan-friendly. \n\nIf you decide to make the Curry Roux from scratch, it only takes 30 minutes. Click here for the recipe.\n\nSecret Ingredients – Personalize Your Curry\nMy mom always adds some grated apples and different condiments to the curry. She says, “If you use just the boxed curry roux, your curry will always taste the same. It will not be different from your neighbor’s curry.”\nSo she taught me two tricks. 1) Use two different brands of curry roux\xa0– you can even mix the spice levels, like mild and medium spicy. 2) Use additional seasonings.\nMy mom and I would use a few combinations of the following ingredients to enhance the flavor and give some complexity to the curry. \n\n* Bold items are our frequently used condiments.\n* Use 1-3 tsp of secret ingredients to start. These are supposed to be “secret” ingredients and you don’t need to add a lot of it.\n* Add the secret ingredients with the broth/water and cook together.\n\nSweet Taste\n\nChutney\nGrated apple\nHoney (Amylase in honey breaks starch and causes viscosity loss; therefore, add honey with broth and cook it. Do not add it after the curry roux as the curry will become watery.)\nKetchup\nMashed banana\nMirin\nOrange/Apricot jam\n\nRefreshing/Sour Taste\n\nLemon (Add right before serving)\nTomato\nYogurt\n\nSpicy Taste\n\nRed chili pepper\nBlack pepper\nCayenne pepper\n\nFragrance\n\nCumin\nBay leaf\nCinnamon \nCurry leaves\n\nUmami and Depth\n\nButter (Add with roux)\nChocolate (Add with roux)\nGarlic cloves (Add while sauteeing)\nFresh ginger (Add while sauteeing)\nInstant coffee\nMilk (Add with roux)\nOyster sauce\nRed wine\nSake\nSoy sauce\nTonkatsu sauce or\xa0Worcestershire Sauce\n\n\n8 Helpful Tips to Make Japanese Chicken Curry\nTip #1: Cut ingredients into uniform shape\nThis helps to cook everything evenly at the same time. \n\nChicken: I recommend a Japanese cutting technique called sogigiri (そぎ切り), which slices the ingredient at an angle for more surface area.\nOnions: I cut into thick wedges for additional texture.\nCarrots: It takes time to cook carrots, so I recommend another Japanese cutting technique called rangiri (乱切り), which is a rotating cut. You rotate the ingredients as you cut. This creates a more open surface.\nPotatoes: I recommend Yukon gold potatoes for curry if you prefer to keep the potato shape in the final presentation. Russet potatoes tend to get dissolved by the end of cooking. Cut into 2 inches (5 cm) size, which is ideal. \n\nTip #2: Cook the onion till tender and golden\nThe nicely browned onions add a ton of flavor to the final curry. If you have an additional 5-10 minutes, caramelize the onion.\nTip #3: Cover the ingredients with just enough broth (or water)\nWhen you add the broth/water, be sure the ingredients are covered with enough water and not submerged completely. The “barely covering” situation is called hita hita (ひたひた) in Japanese. The ingredients will release more moisture into the cooking liquid as you simmer.\nTip #4: Add “Secret Ingredients” to the broth\nAdd your ‘secret ingredients’ with the broth before you bring everything to a simmer, before adding the curry roux. \nTip #5: Do not forget to skim\nSkimming is a significant step in Japanese cooking. We skim the scum and impurities to achieve a refined taste.\nGet a fine mesh skimmer and fill up the measuring cup with water. Skim the impurities and dunk the skimmer in the water to clean. Repeat until the broth is clean.\nTip #6: Add two cubes of curry roux at a time\nMake sure all the curry roux cubes are dissolved completely. You don’t want to bite into a chunk of curry cube while eating!\nFill up a ladle with broth and add two cubes. Using a spoon or chopsticks, let the roux dissolve completely. Then, add two more cubes and repeat.\nTip #7: Watch out when simmering curry\nAlways watch the curry after you add the roux. The thick curry sauce gets burnt easily at the bottom of the pot. \n\nNeed to simmer uncovered for 10 minutes after adding curry roux.\nUse low heat to simmer.\nStay in the kitchen, and keep stirring!\n\nTip #8: Make a big batch and store\nJapanese curry is ideal for freezing. I often cook up a big batch of leftovers and keep them in the refrigerator for a few days or in the freezer for up to a month.\nOh, one more thing! Starches like potatoes and sweet potatoes will change their texture after freezing, so remove them if you plan to freeze the curry.\n\nMake Japanese Curry in a Pressure Cooker\nDo you own an Instant Pot or a pressure cooker? You can also prepare this comfort dish using my Instant Pot (Pressure Cooker) Japanese Curry recipe.\nWhat to Serve with Japanese Curry \n\nWe typically serve the Japanese curry over rice alongside fukujinzuke, a relish made of finely chopped vegetables such as daikon, eggplant, and lotus root, pickled in a soy sauce-based liquid. It will warm you right up! \nI hope you enjoy this delicious Japanese Chicken Curry recipe!\nMore Delicious Japanese Curry Recipes\n\n\nJapanese Beef Curry\nInstant Pot Japanese Curry\nCurry Udon\nKatsu Curry\nCold Curry Udon\n\nWish to learn more about Japanese cooking?\xa0Sign up for our\xa0free\xa0newsletter\xa0to receive cooking tips & recipe\xa0updates!

Please read my blog post on the “secret ingredient” we add to the curry. For this recipe, I add ginger, garlic, apple, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup. To Prepare the IngredientsCut 2 onions into wedges. I like to have the texture of the onions in my curry, so I cut them into thick wedges. If you prefer, you can mince or thinly slice the onions so they disintegrate into the sauce. Peel 2 carrots and cut them into rolling wedges (it‘s called rangiri in Japanese). This type of cut creates more surface area, which helps the carrots absorb more flavor and cook faster. Peel 3 Yukon gold potatoes and cut them into quarters. Soak them in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch. Tip: Yukon gold potatoes hold their shape well. You can use russet potatoes, but they tend to disintegrate into the broth during cooking, so cut them into 6 pieces each and add to the pot toward the end of cooking. Grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and measure 1 tsp ginger with the juice. Set aside. Mince 2 cloves garlic and set aside (I use a garlic press later when adding to the pot). Cut ½ apple into quarters, remove the core, and peel the skin. Grate the apple and set aside. Note: You also could use 1 small lunchbox apple for 8 servings. Cut off the extra fat from 1½ lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs and discard it. Then, cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. I recommend cutting it diagonally (it‘s called sogigiri in Japanese) to create more surface area and flatten each piece so it cooks faster. Season with freshly ground black pepper. Tip: If you will use homemade curry roux, you can lightly season the chicken with kosher salt as well. To Cook the CurryHeat 1½ Tbsp neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion.  Sauté the onions, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Don‘t stir the onions too often because they won’t develop a golden color. Cooked onions add amazing flavor, so we do not want to skip this step. If you have an extra 5 minutes, definitely caramelize the onions! Add the minced garlic (I pass it through a garlic press for a finer texture) and grated ginger and mix well together. Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it‘s no longer pink on the outside. If the onions are getting too brown, reduce the heat to medium low temporarily. Add 4 cups chicken stock/broth. To reduce the sodium, you can substitute with water only or use half stock and half water, if you prefer. Tip: If you‘re using my homemade curry roux, you don‘t need to worry as it does not contain salt. Add the grated apple, 1 Tbsp honey, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp ketchup (or any condiment you choose to add). Please read my blog post for details. Add the carrots and Yukon gold potatoes (if you‘re using russet potatoes, add them later in the last 15–20 minutes of cooking). The broth should barely cover the ingredients. Don‘t worry; we don‘t want too much liquid here, and additional liquid will be released from the meat and vegetables. Simmer, covered*, on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. *Simmer uncovered if the ingredients are completely submerged in the broth. Once boiling, use a fine-mesh strainer to\xa0skim the scum and foam\xa0from the surface of the broth. Continue to cook covered until a wooden skewer goes through the carrots and potatoes. To Add the Curry RouxTurn off the heat. From 1 package Japanese curry roux, put 1–2 cubes in a ladleful of cooking liquid. Slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks and stir into the pot to incorporate. Repeat with the rest of the blocks, 2 cubes at a time. Tip: I use 1 full-sized box of store-bought curry roux, which is typically for 8–12 servings (be careful, as some brands offer a smaller box, which is 4 servings). With my homemade curry roux, I typically use 6–7 cubes for 8 servings (about 80% of the curry roux mixture if it hasn‘t solidified yet). Simmer, uncovered, on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the curry becomes thick, about 5–10 minutes. If your curry is too thick, you can add water to thin the sauce. When you stir, make sure that no roux or food is stuck to the bottom of the pot; otherwise, it may burn. If you use my unsalted homemade curry roux, taste the curry now and add salt to your liking. Tip: I recommend adding 2–4 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, but this will vary based on the brand of the chicken broth and condiments you added. To ServeServe the curry with steamed Japanese short-grain rice on the side. If you like, garnish with fukujinzuke (Japanese red pickled vegetables).  To StoreYou can keep the leftovers in a glass airtight container (so no stains!) and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and in the freezer for a month. The texture of the potatoes will change in the freezer, so you should take them out before freezing. Defrost the frozen curry in the refrigerator for 24 hours before you want to reheat it. To ReheatLeftover curry sauce will thicken into a paste as it cools, so it tends to burn while reheating. To avoid this, stir ½ cup (120 ml) water or more into the leftover sauce until loosened. Then, gently reheat it on low heat. If the sauce seems thin, continue heating with the lid off to reduce the sauce.\nNotesSubstitutions: You can substitute the chicken with beef, pork, shrimp, seafood, tofu, mushrooms, and other vegetables. Since tofu, mushrooms, and vegetables cook quickly, you may not need to simmer them for 15 minutes, except for dense root vegetables like carrots and potatoes here. You can sauté mushrooms and softer vegetables (squash, zucchini, eggplant, etc.) and simmer for 5 minutes or until tender. If you use tofu, you just need to warm it up as it’s is already fully cooked. I recommend draining tofu for 15 minutes prior to use and adding it right after you add the curry roux. Warm it up for the last 5–10 minutes.\nEquipmentsmall potDutch ovenchef's knifewooden skewerschopsticksapple peeler\nNutritionCalories: 576 kcal · Carbohydrates: 81 g · Protein: 25 g · Fat: 18 g · Saturated Fat: 8 g · Polyunsaturated Fat: 2 g · Monounsaturated Fat: 6 g · Trans Fat: 0.4 g · Cholesterol: 107 mg · Sodium: 521 mg · Potassium: 778 mg · Fiber: 6 g · Sugar: 10 g · Vitamin A: 4418 IU · Vitamin C: 21 mg · Calcium: 91 mg · Iron: 6 mg\n\nAuthor: Namiko Hirasawa Chen\nCourse: Main CourseCuisine: JapaneseKeyword: curry roux, japanese curry\n\n\n©JustOneCookbook.com Content and photographs are copyright protected.

Love this recipe. For the nutrition, how much curry is one serving (like, one cup?) and how much rice is in the serving as well (one cup, less than one cup?). I’m trying to track my calories and it would be helpful knowing how much is a serving size for both the rice and curry.

Thank you for trying Nami’s recipe.\nThe current nutritional information contains 150 grams of cooked rice and around one-eighth of this curry recipe.

I would like to know if the nutrition is already with the rice or without it 🙂\nI’ve made this many times and I truly love it so much! I only used a bit of the premade curry roux since it was already very flavourful\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Naomi (JOC Community Manager)\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reply to\xa0\n    \n        Lena\n    \n\n\n\n    1 month ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Lena, Thank you for trying Nami’s recipe!\nThe nutritional information includes rice and is for approximately one serving.

As stated, this recipe essentially produces boiled chicken, as it has no time to develop the tasty crust derived from frying.\nOtherwise, this is a great meal. I’ve kept it in my standard rotation for a number of years now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Naomi (JOC Community Manager)\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reply to\xa0\n    \n        Denny\n    \n\n\n\n    2 months ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi, Denny!

I cannot wait to try to do it next time with homemade fukujinzuke and curry roux.

Please read my disclosure policy.\nDelicious Japanese\xa0chicken curry recipe for a weeknight dinner! Tender pieces of chicken, carrots, and potatoes cooked in a rich, savory curry\xa0sauce, this Japanese version of curry is a must-have for your family meal.\xa0\n\nThis may come as a surprise, but Japanese Curry,\xa0aka Curry Rice (Kare Raisu, カレーライス), is an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan. I grew up on curry rice, as my mom would make it as frequently as I can recall. \nThe bite-sized chunks of meat, the thick-cut vegetables, the rich and creamy brown curry sauce, and the fluffy rice make every bite so comforting and exciting. Not only is it a meal that’s easy to make on busy nights, but it also tastes better on the second day. \nSo, if you wish to master Japanese home cooking, you must add Japanese curry to your repertoire. Let me show you how to make Japanese Chicken Curry (チキンカレー) today!\nTable of contentsWhat is Japanese Curry?Homemade Japanese Curry RouxSecret Ingredients – Personalize Your CurryMake Japanese Curry in a Pressure CookerWhat to Serve with Japanese CurryMore Delicious Japanese Curry Recipes\n\nWhat is Japanese Curry? \nJapanese curry is a thick curry with a stew-like consistency and commonly includes protein, sweet onions, carrots, and potatoes. The sauce is thickened by a roux (a mixture of fat and flour and an addition of curry spices). \nYou can find many variations of Japanese curries, ranging from regions to households, but the most basic one uses chicken, which is the recipe I’m sharing here. \nDon’t miss my Japanese curry recipes roundup, which includes vegetarian curry and more!\nHistory of Japanese Curry\nCurry was introduced to Japan in the late 1800s by the British, and they were initially Western-style stews mixed with curry powder. The Japanese adapted curry to their own version, and ‘Curry Rice’ (Kare Raisu, カレーライス) was born soon after. By the 1950s, S&B Foods developed a convenient instant mix — known as curry roux — in block form so everyone could make curry rice easily at home.\nToday, curry has become a staple of the Japanese home and is widely available in restaurants and food halls in departmental stores. The popularity extends beyond Japan; you can find its presence in many other Asian countries. \nWhat Makes Japanese Curry Different from Other Curries\nJapanese curry is quite different from most other curries worldwide\xa0— it has a thicker consistency, and the taste leans on the sweet and savory side. The unique sweetness comes from onions, carrots, and other additions like honey and grated apples. \nThe sauce resembles a rich, thick demi-glace layered with spices and earthy flavors. Some would describe Japanese curry more like a hearty stew than a typical curry like Thai or Indian. It isn’t spicy, so it is suitable for children.\nIt’s also served with Japanese short-grain rice, which is sticker than basmati rice or long-grain rice. The rice grains also soak up the curry. \n\nThe Base Flavor – Japanese Curry Roux\nThe reason why we can make Japanese curry in a short time is that we use the convenient Japanese Curry Sauce Mix (curry roux カレールー) that comes in a box. The curry roux imparts a unique depth of aromatic spice flavor and creaminess to the dish. I’m not a big fan of “instant” or boxed food, but I have to say Japanese Curry Roux is an exception!\n\nSpice Level\nEach brand of curry roux usually comes with three levels of spiciness — Mild, Medium, or Hot. Since these are packaged for Japanese taste, the hot level is not nearly as spicy as Thai or Indian curry.\nToo Salty?\nSome of you may find the pre-boxed curry roux salty, and I agree. It does have a strong (salty) taste, which is why it goes well with plain steamed rice. The Japanese palate, in general, is gravitated to salty, savory foods. \nHere are my suggestions:\n\nMake my homemade curry roux.\nUse water or half water half chicken stock instead of all chicken stock (because the saltiness of the stock varies).\nUse less curry roux.\nAdd more water to dilute the roux, but note that the curry sauce will be more watery.\n\n\nHomemade Japanese Curry Roux\nAlthough the boxed stuff may spare you some time in the kitchen, you’ll be surprised at how easy it is to make your own Japanese Curry Roux at home. And just like all curries, curry roux is best made from scratch. What are the other good reasons for homemade roux?\n\nNo MSG, artificial flavors, or other food additives are commonly found in boxed mixes.\nYou can customize the flavor, spice level, salt level, and thickness.\nYou can also make it gluten-free or vegetarian/vegan-friendly. \n\nIf you decide to make the Curry Roux from scratch, it only takes 30 minutes. Click here for the recipe.\n\nSecret Ingredients – Personalize Your Curry\nMy mom always adds some grated apples and different condiments to the curry. She says, “If you use just the boxed curry roux, your curry will always taste the same. It will not be different from your neighbor’s curry.”\nSo she taught me two tricks. 1) Use two different brands of curry roux\xa0– you can even mix the spice levels, like mild and medium spicy. 2) Use additional seasonings.\nMy mom and I would use a few combinations of the following ingredients to enhance the flavor and give some complexity to the curry. \n\n* Bold items are our frequently used condiments.\n* Use 1-3 tsp of secret ingredients to start. These are supposed to be “secret” ingredients and you don’t need to add a lot of it.\n* Add the secret ingredients with the broth/water and cook together.\n\nSweet Taste\n\nChutney\nGrated apple\nHoney (Amylase in honey breaks starch and causes viscosity loss; therefore, add honey with broth and cook it. Do not add it after the curry roux as the curry will become watery.)\nKetchup\nMashed banana\nMirin\nOrange/Apricot jam\n\nRefreshing/Sour Taste\n\nLemon (Add right before serving)\nTomato\nYogurt\n\nSpicy Taste\n\nRed chili pepper\nBlack pepper\nCayenne pepper\n\nFragrance\n\nCumin\nBay leaf\nCinnamon \nCurry leaves\n\nUmami and Depth\n\nButter (Add with roux)\nChocolate (Add with roux)\nGarlic cloves (Add while sauteeing)\nFresh ginger (Add while sauteeing)\nInstant coffee\nMilk (Add with roux)\nOyster sauce\nRed wine\nSake\nSoy sauce\nTonkatsu sauce or\xa0Worcestershire Sauce\n\n\n8 Helpful Tips to Make Japanese Chicken Curry\nTip #1: Cut ingredients into uniform shape\nThis helps to cook everything evenly at the same time. \n\nChicken: I recommend a Japanese cutting technique called sogigiri (そぎ切り), which slices the ingredient at an angle for more surface area.\nOnions: I cut into thick wedges for additional texture.\nCarrots: It takes time to cook carrots, so I recommend another Japanese cutting technique called rangiri (乱切り), which is a rotating cut. You rotate the ingredients as you cut. This creates a more open surface.\nPotatoes: I recommend Yukon gold potatoes for curry if you prefer to keep the potato shape in the final presentation. Russet potatoes tend to get dissolved by the end of cooking. Cut into 2 inches (5 cm) size, which is ideal. \n\nTip #2: Cook the onion till tender and golden\nThe nicely browned onions add a ton of flavor to the final curry. If you have an additional 5-10 minutes, caramelize the onion.\nTip #3: Cover the ingredients with just enough broth (or water)\nWhen you add the broth/water, be sure the ingredients are covered with enough water and not submerged completely. The “barely covering” situation is called hita hita (ひたひた) in Japanese. The ingredients will release more moisture into the cooking liquid as you simmer.\nTip #4: Add “Secret Ingredients” to the broth\nAdd your ‘secret ingredients’ with the broth before you bring everything to a simmer, before adding the curry roux. \nTip #5: Do not forget to skim\nSkimming is a significant step in Japanese cooking. We skim the scum and impurities to achieve a refined taste.\nGet a fine mesh skimmer and fill up the measuring cup with water. Skim the impurities and dunk the skimmer in the water to clean. Repeat until the broth is clean.\nTip #6: Add two cubes of curry roux at a time\nMake sure all the curry roux cubes are dissolved completely. You don’t want to bite into a chunk of curry cube while eating!\nFill up a ladle with broth and add two cubes. Using a spoon or chopsticks, let the roux dissolve completely. Then, add two more cubes and repeat.\nTip #7: Watch out when simmering curry\nAlways watch the curry after you add the roux. The thick curry sauce gets burnt easily at the bottom of the pot. \n\nNeed to simmer uncovered for 10 minutes after adding curry roux.\nUse low heat to simmer.\nStay in the kitchen, and keep stirring!\n\nTip #8: Make a big batch and store\nJapanese curry is ideal for freezing. I often cook up a big batch of leftovers and keep them in the refrigerator for a few days or in the freezer for up to a month.\nOh, one more thing! Starches like potatoes and sweet potatoes will change their texture after freezing, so remove them if you plan to freeze the curry.\n\nMake Japanese Curry in a Pressure Cooker\nDo you own an Instant Pot or a pressure cooker? You can also prepare this comfort dish using my Instant Pot (Pressure Cooker) Japanese Curry recipe.\nWhat to Serve with Japanese Curry \n\nWe typically serve the Japanese curry over rice alongside fukujinzuke, a relish made of finely chopped vegetables such as daikon, eggplant, and lotus root, pickled in a soy sauce-based liquid. It will warm you right up! \nI hope you enjoy this delicious Japanese Chicken Curry recipe!\nMore Delicious Japanese Curry Recipes\n\n\nJapanese Beef Curry\nInstant Pot Japanese Curry\nCurry Udon\nKatsu Curry\nCold Curry Udon\n\nWish to learn more about Japanese cooking?\xa0Sign up for our\xa0free\xa0newsletter\xa0to receive cooking tips & recipe\xa0updates!

Please read my blog post on the “secret ingredient” we add to the curry. For this recipe, I add ginger, garlic, apple, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup. To Prepare the IngredientsCut 2 onions into wedges. I like to have the texture of the onions in my curry, so I cut them into thick wedges. If you prefer, you can mince or thinly slice the onions so they disintegrate into the sauce. Peel 2 carrots and cut them into rolling wedges (it‘s called rangiri in Japanese). This type of cut creates more surface area, which helps the carrots absorb more flavor and cook faster. Peel 3 Yukon gold potatoes and cut them into quarters. Soak them in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch. Tip: Yukon gold potatoes hold their shape well. You can use russet potatoes, but they tend to disintegrate into the broth during cooking, so cut them into 6 pieces each and add to the pot toward the end of cooking. Grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and measure 1 tsp ginger with the juice. Set aside. Mince 2 cloves garlic and set aside (I use a garlic press later when adding to the pot). Cut ½ apple into quarters, remove the core, and peel the skin. Grate the apple and set aside. Note: You also could use 1 small lunchbox apple for 8 servings. Cut off the extra fat from 1½ lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs and discard it. Then, cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. I recommend cutting it diagonally (it‘s called sogigiri in Japanese) to create more surface area and flatten each piece so it cooks faster. Season with freshly ground black pepper. Tip: If you will use homemade curry roux, you can lightly season the chicken with kosher salt as well. To Cook the CurryHeat 1½ Tbsp neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion.  Sauté the onions, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Don‘t stir the onions too often because they won’t develop a golden color. Cooked onions add amazing flavor, so we do not want to skip this step. If you have an extra 5 minutes, definitely caramelize the onions! Add the minced garlic (I pass it through a garlic press for a finer texture) and grated ginger and mix well together. Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it‘s no longer pink on the outside. If the onions are getting too brown, reduce the heat to medium low temporarily. Add 4 cups chicken stock/broth. To reduce the sodium, you can substitute with water only or use half stock and half water, if you prefer. Tip: If you‘re using my homemade curry roux, you don‘t need to worry as it does not contain salt. Add the grated apple, 1 Tbsp honey, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp ketchup (or any condiment you choose to add). Please read my blog post for details. Add the carrots and Yukon gold potatoes (if you‘re using russet potatoes, add them later in the last 15–20 minutes of cooking). The broth should barely cover the ingredients. Don‘t worry; we don‘t want too much liquid here, and additional liquid will be released from the meat and vegetables. Simmer, covered*, on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. *Simmer uncovered if the ingredients are completely submerged in the broth. Once boiling, use a fine-mesh strainer to\xa0skim the scum and foam\xa0from the surface of the broth. Continue to cook covered until a wooden skewer goes through the carrots and potatoes. To Add the Curry RouxTurn off the heat. From 1 package Japanese curry roux, put 1–2 cubes in a ladleful of cooking liquid. Slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks and stir into the pot to incorporate. Repeat with the rest of the blocks, 2 cubes at a time. Tip: I use 1 full-sized box of store-bought curry roux, which is typically for 8–12 servings (be careful, as some brands offer a smaller box, which is 4 servings). With my homemade curry roux, I typically use 6–7 cubes for 8 servings (about 80% of the curry roux mixture if it hasn‘t solidified yet). Simmer, uncovered, on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the curry becomes thick, about 5–10 minutes. If your curry is too thick, you can add water to thin the sauce. When you stir, make sure that no roux or food is stuck to the bottom of the pot; otherwise, it may burn. If you use my unsalted homemade curry roux, taste the curry now and add salt to your liking. Tip: I recommend adding 2–4 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, but this will vary based on the brand of the chicken broth and condiments you added. To ServeServe the curry with steamed Japanese short-grain rice on the side. If you like, garnish with fukujinzuke (Japanese red pickled vegetables).  To StoreYou can keep the leftovers in a glass airtight container (so no stains!) and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and in the freezer for a month. The texture of the potatoes will change in the freezer, so you should take them out before freezing. Defrost the frozen curry in the refrigerator for 24 hours before you want to reheat it. To ReheatLeftover curry sauce will thicken into a paste as it cools, so it tends to burn while reheating. To avoid this, stir ½ cup (120 ml) water or more into the leftover sauce until loosened. Then, gently reheat it on low heat. If the sauce seems thin, continue heating with the lid off to reduce the sauce.\nNotesSubstitutions: You can substitute the chicken with beef, pork, shrimp, seafood, tofu, mushrooms, and other vegetables. Since tofu, mushrooms, and vegetables cook quickly, you may not need to simmer them for 15 minutes, except for dense root vegetables like carrots and potatoes here. You can sauté mushrooms and softer vegetables (squash, zucchini, eggplant, etc.) and simmer for 5 minutes or until tender. If you use tofu, you just need to warm it up as it’s is already fully cooked. I recommend draining tofu for 15 minutes prior to use and adding it right after you add the curry roux. Warm it up for the last 5–10 minutes.\nEquipmentsmall potDutch ovenchef's knifewooden skewerschopsticksapple peeler\nNutritionCalories: 576 kcal · Carbohydrates: 81 g · Protein: 25 g · Fat: 18 g · Saturated Fat: 8 g · Polyunsaturated Fat: 2 g · Monounsaturated Fat: 6 g · Trans Fat: 0.4 g · Cholesterol: 107 mg · Sodium: 521 mg · Potassium: 778 mg · Fiber: 6 g · Sugar: 10 g · Vitamin A: 4418 IU · Vitamin C: 21 mg · Calcium: 91 mg · Iron: 6 mg\n\nAuthor: Namiko Hirasawa Chen\nCourse: Main CourseCuisine: JapaneseKeyword: curry roux, japanese curry\n\n\n©JustOneCookbook.com Content and photographs are copyright protected.

Please read my disclosure policy.\nDelicious Japanese\xa0chicken curry recipe for a weeknight dinner! Tender pieces of chicken, carrots, and potatoes cooked in a rich, savory curry\xa0sauce, this Japanese version of curry is a must-have for your family meal.\xa0\n\nThis may come as a surprise, but Japanese Curry,\xa0aka Curry Rice (Kare Raisu, カレーライス), is an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan. I grew up on curry rice, as my mom would make it as frequently as I can recall. \nThe bite-sized chunks of meat, the thick-cut vegetables, the rich and creamy brown curry sauce, and the fluffy rice make every bite so comforting and exciting. Not only is it a meal that’s easy to make on busy nights, but it also tastes better on the second day. \nSo, if you wish to master Japanese home cooking, you must add Japanese curry to your repertoire. Let me show you how to make Japanese Chicken Curry (チキンカレー) today!\nTable of contentsWhat is Japanese Curry?Homemade Japanese Curry RouxSecret Ingredients – Personalize Your CurryMake Japanese Curry in a Pressure CookerWhat to Serve with Japanese CurryMore Delicious Japanese Curry Recipes\n\nWhat is Japanese Curry? \nJapanese curry is a thick curry with a stew-like consistency and commonly includes protein, sweet onions, carrots, and potatoes. The sauce is thickened by a roux (a mixture of fat and flour and an addition of curry spices). \nYou can find many variations of Japanese curries, ranging from regions to households, but the most basic one uses chicken, which is the recipe I’m sharing here. \nDon’t miss my Japanese curry recipes roundup, which includes vegetarian curry and more!\nHistory of Japanese Curry\nCurry was introduced to Japan in the late 1800s by the British, and they were initially Western-style stews mixed with curry powder. The Japanese adapted curry to their own version, and ‘Curry Rice’ (Kare Raisu, カレーライス) was born soon after. By the 1950s, S&B Foods developed a convenient instant mix — known as curry roux — in block form so everyone could make curry rice easily at home.\nToday, curry has become a staple of the Japanese home and is widely available in restaurants and food halls in departmental stores. The popularity extends beyond Japan; you can find its presence in many other Asian countries. \nWhat Makes Japanese Curry Different from Other Curries\nJapanese curry is quite different from most other curries worldwide\xa0— it has a thicker consistency, and the taste leans on the sweet and savory side. The unique sweetness comes from onions, carrots, and other additions like honey and grated apples. \nThe sauce resembles a rich, thick demi-glace layered with spices and earthy flavors. Some would describe Japanese curry more like a hearty stew than a typical curry like Thai or Indian. It isn’t spicy, so it is suitable for children.\nIt’s also served with Japanese short-grain rice, which is sticker than basmati rice or long-grain rice. The rice grains also soak up the curry. \n\nThe Base Flavor – Japanese Curry Roux\nThe reason why we can make Japanese curry in a short time is that we use the convenient Japanese Curry Sauce Mix (curry roux カレールー) that comes in a box. The curry roux imparts a unique depth of aromatic spice flavor and creaminess to the dish. I’m not a big fan of “instant” or boxed food, but I have to say Japanese Curry Roux is an exception!\n\nSpice Level\nEach brand of curry roux usually comes with three levels of spiciness — Mild, Medium, or Hot. Since these are packaged for Japanese taste, the hot level is not nearly as spicy as Thai or Indian curry.\nToo Salty?\nSome of you may find the pre-boxed curry roux salty, and I agree. It does have a strong (salty) taste, which is why it goes well with plain steamed rice. The Japanese palate, in general, is gravitated to salty, savory foods. \nHere are my suggestions:\n\nMake my homemade curry roux.\nUse water or half water half chicken stock instead of all chicken stock (because the saltiness of the stock varies).\nUse less curry roux.\nAdd more water to dilute the roux, but note that the curry sauce will be more watery.\n\n\nHomemade Japanese Curry Roux\nAlthough the boxed stuff may spare you some time in the kitchen, you’ll be surprised at how easy it is to make your own Japanese Curry Roux at home. And just like all curries, curry roux is best made from scratch. What are the other good reasons for homemade roux?\n\nNo MSG, artificial flavors, or other food additives are commonly found in boxed mixes.\nYou can customize the flavor, spice level, salt level, and thickness.\nYou can also make it gluten-free or vegetarian/vegan-friendly. \n\nIf you decide to make the Curry Roux from scratch, it only takes 30 minutes. Click here for the recipe.\n\nSecret Ingredients – Personalize Your Curry\nMy mom always adds some grated apples and different condiments to the curry. She says, “If you use just the boxed curry roux, your curry will always taste the same. It will not be different from your neighbor’s curry.”\nSo she taught me two tricks. 1) Use two different brands of curry roux\xa0– you can even mix the spice levels, like mild and medium spicy. 2) Use additional seasonings.\nMy mom and I would use a few combinations of the following ingredients to enhance the flavor and give some complexity to the curry. \n\n* Bold items are our frequently used condiments.\n* Use 1-3 tsp of secret ingredients to start. These are supposed to be “secret” ingredients and you don’t need to add a lot of it.\n* Add the secret ingredients with the broth/water and cook together.\n\nSweet Taste\n\nChutney\nGrated apple\nHoney (Amylase in honey breaks starch and causes viscosity loss; therefore, add honey with broth and cook it. Do not add it after the curry roux as the curry will become watery.)\nKetchup\nMashed banana\nMirin\nOrange/Apricot jam\n\nRefreshing/Sour Taste\n\nLemon (Add right before serving)\nTomato\nYogurt\n\nSpicy Taste\n\nRed chili pepper\nBlack pepper\nCayenne pepper\n\nFragrance\n\nCumin\nBay leaf\nCinnamon \nCurry leaves\n\nUmami and Depth\n\nButter (Add with roux)\nChocolate (Add with roux)\nGarlic cloves (Add while sauteeing)\nFresh ginger (Add while sauteeing)\nInstant coffee\nMilk (Add with roux)\nOyster sauce\nRed wine\nSake\nSoy sauce\nTonkatsu sauce or\xa0Worcestershire Sauce\n\n\n8 Helpful Tips to Make Japanese Chicken Curry\nTip #1: Cut ingredients into uniform shape\nThis helps to cook everything evenly at the same time. \n\nChicken: I recommend a Japanese cutting technique called sogigiri (そぎ切り), which slices the ingredient at an angle for more surface area.\nOnions: I cut into thick wedges for additional texture.\nCarrots: It takes time to cook carrots, so I recommend another Japanese cutting technique called rangiri (乱切り), which is a rotating cut. You rotate the ingredients as you cut. This creates a more open surface.\nPotatoes: I recommend Yukon gold potatoes for curry if you prefer to keep the potato shape in the final presentation. Russet potatoes tend to get dissolved by the end of cooking. Cut into 2 inches (5 cm) size, which is ideal. \n\nTip #2: Cook the onion till tender and golden\nThe nicely browned onions add a ton of flavor to the final curry. If you have an additional 5-10 minutes, caramelize the onion.\nTip #3: Cover the ingredients with just enough broth (or water)\nWhen you add the broth/water, be sure the ingredients are covered with enough water and not submerged completely. The “barely covering” situation is called hita hita (ひたひた) in Japanese. The ingredients will release more moisture into the cooking liquid as you simmer.\nTip #4: Add “Secret Ingredients” to the broth\nAdd your ‘secret ingredients’ with the broth before you bring everything to a simmer, before adding the curry roux. \nTip #5: Do not forget to skim\nSkimming is a significant step in Japanese cooking. We skim the scum and impurities to achieve a refined taste.\nGet a fine mesh skimmer and fill up the measuring cup with water. Skim the impurities and dunk the skimmer in the water to clean. Repeat until the broth is clean.\nTip #6: Add two cubes of curry roux at a time\nMake sure all the curry roux cubes are dissolved completely. You don’t want to bite into a chunk of curry cube while eating!\nFill up a ladle with broth and add two cubes. Using a spoon or chopsticks, let the roux dissolve completely. Then, add two more cubes and repeat.\nTip #7: Watch out when simmering curry\nAlways watch the curry after you add the roux. The thick curry sauce gets burnt easily at the bottom of the pot. \n\nNeed to simmer uncovered for 10 minutes after adding curry roux.\nUse low heat to simmer.\nStay in the kitchen, and keep stirring!\n\nTip #8: Make a big batch and store\nJapanese curry is ideal for freezing. I often cook up a big batch of leftovers and keep them in the refrigerator for a few days or in the freezer for up to a month.\nOh, one more thing! Starches like potatoes and sweet potatoes will change their texture after freezing, so remove them if you plan to freeze the curry.\n\nMake Japanese Curry in a Pressure Cooker\nDo you own an Instant Pot or a pressure cooker? You can also prepare this comfort dish using my Instant Pot (Pressure Cooker) Japanese Curry recipe.\nWhat to Serve with Japanese Curry \n\nWe typically serve the Japanese curry over rice alongside fukujinzuke, a relish made of finely chopped vegetables such as daikon, eggplant, and lotus root, pickled in a soy sauce-based liquid. It will warm you right up! \nI hope you enjoy this delicious Japanese Chicken Curry recipe!\nMore Delicious Japanese Curry Recipes\n\n\nJapanese Beef Curry\nInstant Pot Japanese Curry\nCurry Udon\nKatsu Curry\nCold Curry Udon\n\nWish to learn more about Japanese cooking?\xa0Sign up for our\xa0free\xa0newsletter\xa0to receive cooking tips & recipe\xa0updates!

Please read my blog post on the “secret ingredient” we add to the curry. For this recipe, I add ginger, garlic, apple, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup. To Prepare the IngredientsCut 2 onions into wedges. I like to have the texture of the onions in my curry, so I cut them into thick wedges. If you prefer, you can mince or thinly slice the onions so they disintegrate into the sauce. Peel 2 carrots and cut them into rolling wedges (it‘s called rangiri in Japanese). This type of cut creates more surface area, which helps the carrots absorb more flavor and cook faster. Peel 3 Yukon gold potatoes and cut them into quarters. Soak them in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch. Tip: Yukon gold potatoes hold their shape well. You can use russet potatoes, but they tend to disintegrate into the broth during cooking, so cut them into 6 pieces each and add to the pot toward the end of cooking. Grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and measure 1 tsp ginger with the juice. Set aside. Mince 2 cloves garlic and set aside (I use a garlic press later when adding to the pot). Cut ½ apple into quarters, remove the core, and peel the skin. Grate the apple and set aside. Note: You also could use 1 small lunchbox apple for 8 servings. Cut off the extra fat from 1½ lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs and discard it. Then, cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. I recommend cutting it diagonally (it‘s called sogigiri in Japanese) to create more surface area and flatten each piece so it cooks faster. Season with freshly ground black pepper. Tip: If you will use homemade curry roux, you can lightly season the chicken with kosher salt as well. To Cook the CurryHeat 1½ Tbsp neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion.  Sauté the onions, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Don‘t stir the onions too often because they won’t develop a golden color. Cooked onions add amazing flavor, so we do not want to skip this step. If you have an extra 5 minutes, definitely caramelize the onions! Add the minced garlic (I pass it through a garlic press for a finer texture) and grated ginger and mix well together. Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it‘s no longer pink on the outside. If the onions are getting too brown, reduce the heat to medium low temporarily. Add 4 cups chicken stock/broth. To reduce the sodium, you can substitute with water only or use half stock and half water, if you prefer. Tip: If you‘re using my homemade curry roux, you don‘t need to worry as it does not contain salt. Add the grated apple, 1 Tbsp honey, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp ketchup (or any condiment you choose to add). Please read my blog post for details. Add the carrots and Yukon gold potatoes (if you‘re using russet potatoes, add them later in the last 15–20 minutes of cooking). The broth should barely cover the ingredients. Don‘t worry; we don‘t want too much liquid here, and additional liquid will be released from the meat and vegetables. Simmer, covered*, on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. *Simmer uncovered if the ingredients are completely submerged in the broth. Once boiling, use a fine-mesh strainer to\xa0skim the scum and foam\xa0from the surface of the broth. Continue to cook covered until a wooden skewer goes through the carrots and potatoes. To Add the Curry RouxTurn off the heat. From 1 package Japanese curry roux, put 1–2 cubes in a ladleful of cooking liquid. Slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks and stir into the pot to incorporate. Repeat with the rest of the blocks, 2 cubes at a time. Tip: I use 1 full-sized box of store-bought curry roux, which is typically for 8–12 servings (be careful, as some brands offer a smaller box, which is 4 servings). With my homemade curry roux, I typically use 6–7 cubes for 8 servings (about 80% of the curry roux mixture if it hasn‘t solidified yet). Simmer, uncovered, on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the curry becomes thick, about 5–10 minutes. If your curry is too thick, you can add water to thin the sauce. When you stir, make sure that no roux or food is stuck to the bottom of the pot; otherwise, it may burn. If you use my unsalted homemade curry roux, taste the curry now and add salt to your liking. Tip: I recommend adding 2–4 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, but this will vary based on the brand of the chicken broth and condiments you added. To ServeServe the curry with steamed Japanese short-grain rice on the side. If you like, garnish with fukujinzuke (Japanese red pickled vegetables).  To StoreYou can keep the leftovers in a glass airtight container (so no stains!) and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and in the freezer for a month. The texture of the potatoes will change in the freezer, so you should take them out before freezing. Defrost the frozen curry in the refrigerator for 24 hours before you want to reheat it. To ReheatLeftover curry sauce will thicken into a paste as it cools, so it tends to burn while reheating. To avoid this, stir ½ cup (120 ml) water or more into the leftover sauce until loosened. Then, gently reheat it on low heat. If the sauce seems thin, continue heating with the lid off to reduce the sauce.\nNotesSubstitutions: You can substitute the chicken with beef, pork, shrimp, seafood, tofu, mushrooms, and other vegetables. Since tofu, mushrooms, and vegetables cook quickly, you may not need to simmer them for 15 minutes, except for dense root vegetables like carrots and potatoes here. You can sauté mushrooms and softer vegetables (squash, zucchini, eggplant, etc.) and simmer for 5 minutes or until tender. If you use tofu, you just need to warm it up as it’s is already fully cooked. I recommend draining tofu for 15 minutes prior to use and adding it right after you add the curry roux. Warm it up for the last 5–10 minutes.\nEquipmentsmall potDutch ovenchef's knifewooden skewerschopsticksapple peeler\nNutritionCalories: 576 kcal · Carbohydrates: 81 g · Protein: 25 g · Fat: 18 g · Saturated Fat: 8 g · Polyunsaturated Fat: 2 g · Monounsaturated Fat: 6 g · Trans Fat: 0.4 g · Cholesterol: 107 mg · Sodium: 521 mg · Potassium: 778 mg · Fiber: 6 g · Sugar: 10 g · Vitamin A: 4418 IU · Vitamin C: 21 mg · Calcium: 91 mg · Iron: 6 mg\n\nAuthor: Namiko Hirasawa Chen\nCourse: Main CourseCuisine: JapaneseKeyword: curry roux, japanese curry\n\n\n©JustOneCookbook.com Content and photographs are copyright protected.

Love this recipe. For the nutrition, how much curry is one serving (like, one cup?) and how much rice is in the serving as well (one cup, less than one cup?). I’m trying to track my calories and it would be helpful knowing how much is a serving size for both the rice and curry.

As stated, this recipe essentially produces boiled chicken, as it has no time to develop the tasty crust derived from frying.\nOtherwise, this is a great meal.

I cannot wait to try to do it next time with homemade fukujinzuke and curry roux.

Please read my disclosure policy.\nDelicious Japanese\xa0chicken curry recipe for a weeknight dinner! Tender pieces of chicken, carrots, and potatoes cooked in a rich, savory curry\xa0sauce, this Japanese version of curry is a must-have for your family meal.\xa0\n\nThis may come as a surprise, but Japanese Curry,\xa0aka Curry Rice (Kare Raisu, カレーライス), is an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan. I grew up on curry rice, as my mom would make it as frequently as I can recall. \nThe bite-sized chunks of meat, the thick-cut vegetables, the rich and creamy brown curry sauce, and the fluffy rice make every bite so comforting and exciting. Not only is it a meal that’s easy to make on busy nights, but it also tastes better on the second day. \nSo, if you wish to master Japanese home cooking, you must add Japanese curry to your repertoire. Let me show you how to make Japanese Chicken Curry (チキンカレー) today!\nTable of contentsWhat is Japanese Curry?Homemade Japanese Curry RouxSecret Ingredients – Personalize Your CurryMake Japanese Curry in a Pressure CookerWhat to Serve with Japanese CurryMore Delicious Japanese Curry Recipes\n\nWhat is Japanese Curry? \nJapanese curry is a thick curry with a stew-like consistency and commonly includes protein, sweet onions, carrots, and potatoes. The sauce is thickened by a roux (a mixture of fat and flour and an addition of curry spices). \nYou can find many variations of Japanese curries, ranging from regions to households, but the most basic one uses chicken, which is the recipe I’m sharing here. \nDon’t miss my Japanese curry recipes roundup, which includes vegetarian curry and more!\nHistory of Japanese Curry\nCurry was introduced to Japan in the late 1800s by the British, and they were initially Western-style stews mixed with curry powder. The Japanese adapted curry to their own version, and ‘Curry Rice’ (Kare Raisu, カレーライス) was born soon after. By the 1950s, S&B Foods developed a convenient instant mix — known as curry roux — in block form so everyone could make curry rice easily at home.\nToday, curry has become a staple of the Japanese home and is widely available in restaurants and food halls in departmental stores. The popularity extends beyond Japan; you can find its presence in many other Asian countries. \nWhat Makes Japanese Curry Different from Other Curries\nJapanese curry is quite different from most other curries worldwide\xa0— it has a thicker consistency, and the taste leans on the sweet and savory side. The unique sweetness comes from onions, carrots, and other additions like honey and grated apples. \nThe sauce resembles a rich, thick demi-glace layered with spices and earthy flavors. Some would describe Japanese curry more like a hearty stew than a typical curry like Thai or Indian. It isn’t spicy, so it is suitable for children.\nIt’s also served with Japanese short-grain rice, which is sticker than basmati rice or long-grain rice. The rice grains also soak up the curry. \n\nThe Base Flavor – Japanese Curry Roux\nThe reason why we can make Japanese curry in a short time is that we use the convenient Japanese Curry Sauce Mix (curry roux カレールー) that comes in a box. The curry roux imparts a unique depth of aromatic spice flavor and creaminess to the dish. I’m not a big fan of “instant” or boxed food, but I have to say Japanese Curry Roux is an exception!\n\nSpice Level\nEach brand of curry roux usually comes with three levels of spiciness — Mild, Medium, or Hot. Since these are packaged for Japanese taste, the hot level is not nearly as spicy as Thai or Indian curry.\nToo Salty?\nSome of you may find the pre-boxed curry roux salty, and I agree. It does have a strong (salty) taste, which is why it goes well with plain steamed rice. The Japanese palate, in general, is gravitated to salty, savory foods. \nHere are my suggestions:\n\nMake my homemade curry roux.\nUse water or half water half chicken stock instead of all chicken stock (because the saltiness of the stock varies).\nUse less curry roux.\nAdd more water to dilute the roux, but note that the curry sauce will be more watery.\n\n\nHomemade Japanese Curry Roux\nAlthough the boxed stuff may spare you some time in the kitchen, you’ll be surprised at how easy it is to make your own Japanese Curry Roux at home. And just like all curries, curry roux is best made from scratch. What are the other good reasons for homemade roux?\n\nNo MSG, artificial flavors, or other food additives are commonly found in boxed mixes.\nYou can customize the flavor, spice level, salt level, and thickness.\nYou can also make it gluten-free or vegetarian/vegan-friendly. \n\nIf you decide to make the Curry Roux from scratch, it only takes 30 minutes. Click here for the recipe.\n\nSecret Ingredients – Personalize Your Curry\nMy mom always adds some grated apples and different condiments to the curry. She says, “If you use just the boxed curry roux, your curry will always taste the same. It will not be different from your neighbor’s curry.”\nSo she taught me two tricks. 1) Use two different brands of curry roux\xa0– you can even mix the spice levels, like mild and medium spicy. 2) Use additional seasonings.\nMy mom and I would use a few combinations of the following ingredients to enhance the flavor and give some complexity to the curry. \n\n* Bold items are our frequently used condiments.\n* Use 1-3 tsp of secret ingredients to start. These are supposed to be “secret” ingredients and you don’t need to add a lot of it.\n* Add the secret ingredients with the broth/water and cook together.\n\nSweet Taste\n\nChutney\nGrated apple\nHoney (Amylase in honey breaks starch and causes viscosity loss; therefore, add honey with broth and cook it. Do not add it after the curry roux as the curry will become watery.)\nKetchup\nMashed banana\nMirin\nOrange/Apricot jam\n\nRefreshing/Sour Taste\n\nLemon (Add right before serving)\nTomato\nYogurt\n\nSpicy Taste\n\nRed chili pepper\nBlack pepper\nCayenne pepper\n\nFragrance\n\nCumin\nBay leaf\nCinnamon \nCurry leaves\n\nUmami and Depth\n\nButter (Add with roux)\nChocolate (Add with roux)\nGarlic cloves (Add while sauteeing)\nFresh ginger (Add while sauteeing)\nInstant coffee\nMilk (Add with roux)\nOyster sauce\nRed wine\nSake\nSoy sauce\nTonkatsu sauce or\xa0Worcestershire Sauce\n\n\n8 Helpful Tips to Make Japanese Chicken Curry\nTip #1: Cut ingredients into uniform shape\nThis helps to cook everything evenly at the same time. \n\nChicken: I recommend a Japanese cutting technique called sogigiri (そぎ切り), which slices the ingredient at an angle for more surface area.\nOnions: I cut into thick wedges for additional texture.\nCarrots: It takes time to cook carrots, so I recommend another Japanese cutting technique called rangiri (乱切り), which is a rotating cut. You rotate the ingredients as you cut. This creates a more open surface.\nPotatoes: I recommend Yukon gold potatoes for curry if you prefer to keep the potato shape in the final presentation. Russet potatoes tend to get dissolved by the end of cooking. Cut into 2 inches (5 cm) size, which is ideal. \n\nTip #2: Cook the onion till tender and golden\nThe nicely browned onions add a ton of flavor to the final curry. If you have an additional 5-10 minutes, caramelize the onion.\nTip #3: Cover the ingredients with just enough broth (or water)\nWhen you add the broth/water, be sure the ingredients are covered with enough water and not submerged completely. The “barely covering” situation is called hita hita (ひたひた) in Japanese. The ingredients will release more moisture into the cooking liquid as you simmer.\nTip #4: Add “Secret Ingredients” to the broth\nAdd your ‘secret ingredients’ with the broth before you bring everything to a simmer, before adding the curry roux. \nTip #5: Do not forget to skim\nSkimming is a significant step in Japanese cooking. We skim the scum and impurities to achieve a refined taste.\nGet a fine mesh skimmer and fill up the measuring cup with water. Skim the impurities and dunk the skimmer in the water to clean. Repeat until the broth is clean.\nTip #6: Add two cubes of curry roux at a time\nMake sure all the curry roux cubes are dissolved completely. You don’t want to bite into a chunk of curry cube while eating!\nFill up a ladle with broth and add two cubes. Using a spoon or chopsticks, let the roux dissolve completely. Then, add two more cubes and repeat.\nTip #7: Watch out when simmering curry\nAlways watch the curry after you add the roux. The thick curry sauce gets burnt easily at the bottom of the pot. \n\nNeed to simmer uncovered for 10 minutes after adding curry roux.\nUse low heat to simmer.\nStay in the kitchen, and keep stirring!\n\nTip #8: Make a big batch and store\nJapanese curry is ideal for freezing. I often cook up a big batch of leftovers and keep them in the refrigerator for a few days or in the freezer for up to a month.\nOh, one more thing! Starches like potatoes and sweet potatoes will change their texture after freezing, so remove them if you plan to freeze the curry.\n\nMake Japanese Curry in a Pressure Cooker\nDo you own an Instant Pot or a pressure cooker? You can also prepare this comfort dish using my Instant Pot (Pressure Cooker) Japanese Curry recipe.\nWhat to Serve with Japanese Curry \n\nWe typically serve the Japanese curry over rice alongside fukujinzuke, a relish made of finely chopped vegetables such as daikon, eggplant, and lotus root, pickled in a soy sauce-based liquid. It will warm you right up! \nI hope you enjoy this delicious Japanese Chicken Curry recipe!\nMore Delicious Japanese Curry Recipes\n\n\nJapanese Beef Curry\nInstant Pot Japanese Curry\nCurry Udon\nKatsu Curry\nCold Curry Udon\n\nWish to learn more about Japanese cooking?\xa0Sign up for our\xa0free\xa0newsletter\xa0to receive cooking tips & recipe\xa0updates!

Please read my blog post on the “secret ingredient” we add to the curry. For this recipe, I add ginger, garlic, apple, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup. To Prepare the IngredientsCut 2 onions into wedges. I like to have the texture of the onions in my curry, so I cut them into thick wedges. If you prefer, you can mince or thinly slice the onions so they disintegrate into the sauce. Peel 2 carrots and cut them into rolling wedges (it‘s called rangiri in Japanese). This type of cut creates more surface area, which helps the carrots absorb more flavor and cook faster. Peel 3 Yukon gold potatoes and cut them into quarters. Soak them in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch. Tip: Yukon gold potatoes hold their shape well. You can use russet potatoes, but they tend to disintegrate into the broth during cooking, so cut them into 6 pieces each and add to the pot toward the end of cooking. Grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and measure 1 tsp ginger with the juice. Set aside. Mince 2 cloves garlic and set aside (I use a garlic press later when adding to the pot). Cut ½ apple into quarters, remove the core, and peel the skin. Grate the apple and set aside. Note: You also could use 1 small lunchbox apple for 8 servings. Cut off the extra fat from 1½ lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs and discard it. Then, cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. I recommend cutting it diagonally (it‘s called sogigiri in Japanese) to create more surface area and flatten each piece so it cooks faster. Season with freshly ground black pepper. Tip: If you will use homemade curry roux, you can lightly season the chicken with kosher salt as well. To Cook the CurryHeat 1½ Tbsp neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion.  Sauté the onions, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Don‘t stir the onions too often because they won’t develop a golden color. Cooked onions add amazing flavor, so we do not want to skip this step. If you have an extra 5 minutes, definitely caramelize the onions! Add the minced garlic (I pass it through a garlic press for a finer texture) and grated ginger and mix well together. Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it‘s no longer pink on the outside. If the onions are getting too brown, reduce the heat to medium low temporarily. Add 4 cups chicken stock/broth. To reduce the sodium, you can substitute with water only or use half stock and half water, if you prefer. Tip: If you‘re using my homemade curry roux, you don‘t need to worry as it does not contain salt. Add the grated apple, 1 Tbsp honey, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp ketchup (or any condiment you choose to add). Please read my blog post for details. Add the carrots and Yukon gold potatoes (if you‘re using russet potatoes, add them later in the last 15–20 minutes of cooking). The broth should barely cover the ingredients. Don‘t worry; we don‘t want too much liquid here, and additional liquid will be released from the meat and vegetables. Simmer, covered*, on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. *Simmer uncovered if the ingredients are completely submerged in the broth. Once boiling, use a fine-mesh strainer to\xa0skim the scum and foam\xa0from the surface of the broth. Continue to cook covered until a wooden skewer goes through the carrots and potatoes. To Add the Curry RouxTurn off the heat. From 1 package Japanese curry roux, put 1–2 cubes in a ladleful of cooking liquid. Slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks and stir into the pot to incorporate. Repeat with the rest of the blocks, 2 cubes at a time. Tip: I use 1 full-sized box of store-bought curry roux, which is typically for 8–12 servings (be careful, as some brands offer a smaller box, which is 4 servings). With my homemade curry roux, I typically use 6–7 cubes for 8 servings (about 80% of the curry roux mixture if it hasn‘t solidified yet). Simmer, uncovered, on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the curry becomes thick, about 5–10 minutes. If your curry is too thick, you can add water to thin the sauce. When you stir, make sure that no roux or food is stuck to the bottom of the pot; otherwise, it may burn. If you use my unsalted homemade curry roux, taste the curry now and add salt to your liking. Tip: I recommend adding 2–4 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, but this will vary based on the brand of the chicken broth and condiments you added. To ServeServe the curry with steamed Japanese short-grain rice on the side. If you like, garnish with fukujinzuke (Japanese red pickled vegetables).  To StoreYou can keep the leftovers in a glass airtight container (so no stains!) and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and in the freezer for a month. The texture of the potatoes will change in the freezer, so you should take them out before freezing. Defrost the frozen curry in the refrigerator for 24 hours before you want to reheat it. To ReheatLeftover curry sauce will thicken into a paste as it cools, so it tends to burn while reheating. To avoid this, stir ½ cup (120 ml) water or more into the leftover sauce until loosened. Then, gently reheat it on low heat. If the sauce seems thin, continue heating with the lid off to reduce the sauce.\nNotesSubstitutions: You can substitute the chicken with beef, pork, shrimp, seafood, tofu, mushrooms, and other vegetables. Since tofu, mushrooms, and vegetables cook quickly, you may not need to simmer them for 15 minutes, except for dense root vegetables like carrots and potatoes here. You can sauté mushrooms and softer vegetables (squash, zucchini, eggplant, etc.) and simmer for 5 minutes or until tender. If you use tofu, you just need to warm it up as it’s is already fully cooked. I recommend draining tofu for 15 minutes prior to use and adding it right after you add the curry roux. Warm it up for the last 5–10 minutes.\nEquipmentsmall potDutch ovenchef's knifewooden skewerschopsticksapple peeler\nNutritionCalories: 576 kcal · Carbohydrates: 81 g · Protein: 25 g · Fat: 18 g · Saturated Fat: 8 g · Polyunsaturated Fat: 2 g · Monounsaturated Fat: 6 g · Trans Fat: 0.4 g · Cholesterol: 107 mg · Sodium: 521 mg · Potassium: 778 mg · Fiber: 6 g · Sugar: 10 g · Vitamin A: 4418 IU · Vitamin C: 21 mg · Calcium: 91 mg · Iron: 6 mg\n\nAuthor: Namiko Hirasawa Chen\nCourse: Main CourseCuisine: JapaneseKeyword: curry roux, japanese curry\n\n\n©JustOneCookbook.com Content and photographs are copyright protected.

Love this recipe. For the nutrition, how much curry is one serving (like, one cup?) and how much rice is in the serving as well (one cup, less than one cup?). I’m trying to track my calories and it would be helpful knowing how much is a serving size for both the rice and curry.

Thank you for trying Nami’s recipe.\nThe current nutritional information contains 150 grams of cooked rice and around one-eighth of this curry recipe.

I would like to know if the nutrition is already with the rice or without it 🙂\nI’ve made this many times and I truly love it so much! I only used a bit of the premade curry roux since it was already very flavourful\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Naomi (JOC Community Manager)\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reply to\xa0\n    \n        Lena\n    \n\n\n\n    1 month ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Lena, Thank you for trying Nami’s recipe!\nThe nutritional information includes rice and is for approximately one serving.

As stated, this recipe essentially produces boiled chicken, as it has no time to develop the tasty crust derived from frying.\nOtherwise, this is a great meal. I’ve kept it in my standard rotation for a number of years now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Naomi (JOC Community Manager)\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reply to\xa0\n    \n        Denny\n    \n\n\n\n    2 months ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi, Denny!

I cannot wait to try to do it next time with homemade fukujinzuke and curry roux. Thank you a lot, it was easy to make it perfectly 🤗\nP.S. : also thank you for adding the possibility to choose the metric quantities, it helps a lot and saves time for someone from France\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Naomi (JOC Community Manager)\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reply to\xa0\n    \n        Victoria\n    \n\n\n\n    2 months ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi, Victoria!

Please read my disclosure policy.\nDelicious Japanese\xa0chicken curry recipe for a weeknight dinner! Tender pieces of chicken, carrots, and potatoes cooked in a rich, savory curry\xa0sauce, this Japanese version of curry is a must-have for your family meal.\xa0\n\nThis may come as a surprise, but Japanese Curry,\xa0aka Curry Rice (Kare Raisu, カレーライス), is an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan. I grew up on curry rice, as my mom would make it as frequently as I can recall. \nThe bite-sized chunks of meat, the thick-cut vegetables, the rich and creamy brown curry sauce, and the fluffy rice make every bite so comforting and exciting. Not only is it a meal that’s easy to make on busy nights, but it also tastes better on the second day. \nSo, if you wish to master Japanese home cooking, you must add Japanese curry to your repertoire. Let me show you how to make Japanese Chicken Curry (チキンカレー) today!\nTable of contentsWhat is Japanese Curry?Homemade Japanese Curry RouxSecret Ingredients – Personalize Your CurryMake Japanese Curry in a Pressure CookerWhat to Serve with Japanese CurryMore Delicious Japanese Curry Recipes\n\nWhat is Japanese Curry? \nJapanese curry is a thick curry with a stew-like consistency and commonly includes protein, sweet onions, carrots, and potatoes. The sauce is thickened by a roux (a mixture of fat and flour and an addition of curry spices). \nYou can find many variations of Japanese curries, ranging from regions to households, but the most basic one uses chicken, which is the recipe I’m sharing here. \nDon’t miss my Japanese curry recipes roundup, which includes vegetarian curry and more!\nHistory of Japanese Curry\nCurry was introduced to Japan in the late 1800s by the British, and they were initially Western-style stews mixed with curry powder. The Japanese adapted curry to their own version, and ‘Curry Rice’ (Kare Raisu, カレーライス) was born soon after. By the 1950s, S&B Foods developed a convenient instant mix — known as curry roux — in block form so everyone could make curry rice easily at home.\nToday, curry has become a staple of the Japanese home and is widely available in restaurants and food halls in departmental stores. The popularity extends beyond Japan; you can find its presence in many other Asian countries. \nWhat Makes Japanese Curry Different from Other Curries\nJapanese curry is quite different from most other curries worldwide\xa0— it has a thicker consistency, and the taste leans on the sweet and savory side. The unique sweetness comes from onions, carrots, and other additions like honey and grated apples. \nThe sauce resembles a rich, thick demi-glace layered with spices and earthy flavors. Some would describe Japanese curry more like a hearty stew than a typical curry like Thai or Indian. It isn’t spicy, so it is suitable for children.\nIt’s also served with Japanese short-grain rice, which is sticker than basmati rice or long-grain rice. The rice grains also soak up the curry. \n\nThe Base Flavor – Japanese Curry Roux\nThe reason why we can make Japanese curry in a short time is that we use the convenient Japanese Curry Sauce Mix (curry roux カレールー) that comes in a box. The curry roux imparts a unique depth of aromatic spice flavor and creaminess to the dish. I’m not a big fan of “instant” or boxed food, but I have to say Japanese Curry Roux is an exception!\n\nSpice Level\nEach brand of curry roux usually comes with three levels of spiciness — Mild, Medium, or Hot. Since these are packaged for Japanese taste, the hot level is not nearly as spicy as Thai or Indian curry.\nToo Salty?\nSome of you may find the pre-boxed curry roux salty, and I agree. It does have a strong (salty) taste, which is why it goes well with plain steamed rice. The Japanese palate, in general, is gravitated to salty, savory foods. \nHere are my suggestions:\n\nMake my homemade curry roux.\nUse water or half water half chicken stock instead of all chicken stock (because the saltiness of the stock varies).\nUse less curry roux.\nAdd more water to dilute the roux, but note that the curry sauce will be more watery.\n\n\nHomemade Japanese Curry Roux\nAlthough the boxed stuff may spare you some time in the kitchen, you’ll be surprised at how easy it is to make your own Japanese Curry Roux at home. And just like all curries, curry roux is best made from scratch. What are the other good reasons for homemade roux?\n\nNo MSG, artificial flavors, or other food additives are commonly found in boxed mixes.\nYou can customize the flavor, spice level, salt level, and thickness.\nYou can also make it gluten-free or vegetarian/vegan-friendly. \n\nIf you decide to make the Curry Roux from scratch, it only takes 30 minutes. Click here for the recipe.\n\nSecret Ingredients – Personalize Your Curry\nMy mom always adds some grated apples and different condiments to the curry. She says, “If you use just the boxed curry roux, your curry will always taste the same. It will not be different from your neighbor’s curry.”\nSo she taught me two tricks. 1) Use two different brands of curry roux\xa0– you can even mix the spice levels, like mild and medium spicy. 2) Use additional seasonings.\nMy mom and I would use a few combinations of the following ingredients to enhance the flavor and give some complexity to the curry. \n\n* Bold items are our frequently used condiments.\n* Use 1-3 tsp of secret ingredients to start. These are supposed to be “secret” ingredients and you don’t need to add a lot of it.\n* Add the secret ingredients with the broth/water and cook together.\n\nSweet Taste\n\nChutney\nGrated apple\nHoney (Amylase in honey breaks starch and causes viscosity loss; therefore, add honey with broth and cook it. Do not add it after the curry roux as the curry will become watery.)\nKetchup\nMashed banana\nMirin\nOrange/Apricot jam\n\nRefreshing/Sour Taste\n\nLemon (Add right before serving)\nTomato\nYogurt\n\nSpicy Taste\n\nRed chili pepper\nBlack pepper\nCayenne pepper\n\nFragrance\n\nCumin\nBay leaf\nCinnamon \nCurry leaves\n\nUmami and Depth\n\nButter (Add with roux)\nChocolate (Add with roux)\nGarlic cloves (Add while sauteeing)\nFresh ginger (Add while sauteeing)\nInstant coffee\nMilk (Add with roux)\nOyster sauce\nRed wine\nSake\nSoy sauce\nTonkatsu sauce or\xa0Worcestershire Sauce\n\n\n8 Helpful Tips to Make Japanese Chicken Curry\nTip #1: Cut ingredients into uniform shape\nThis helps to cook everything evenly at the same time. \n\nChicken: I recommend a Japanese cutting technique called sogigiri (そぎ切り), which slices the ingredient at an angle for more surface area.\nOnions: I cut into thick wedges for additional texture.\nCarrots: It takes time to cook carrots, so I recommend another Japanese cutting technique called rangiri (乱切り), which is a rotating cut. You rotate the ingredients as you cut. This creates a more open surface.\nPotatoes: I recommend Yukon gold potatoes for curry if you prefer to keep the potato shape in the final presentation. Russet potatoes tend to get dissolved by the end of cooking. Cut into 2 inches (5 cm) size, which is ideal. \n\nTip #2: Cook the onion till tender and golden\nThe nicely browned onions add a ton of flavor to the final curry. If you have an additional 5-10 minutes, caramelize the onion.\nTip #3: Cover the ingredients with just enough broth (or water)\nWhen you add the broth/water, be sure the ingredients are covered with enough water and not submerged completely. The “barely covering” situation is called hita hita (ひたひた) in Japanese. The ingredients will release more moisture into the cooking liquid as you simmer.\nTip #4: Add “Secret Ingredients” to the broth\nAdd your ‘secret ingredients’ with the broth before you bring everything to a simmer, before adding the curry roux. \nTip #5: Do not forget to skim\nSkimming is a significant step in Japanese cooking. We skim the scum and impurities to achieve a refined taste.\nGet a fine mesh skimmer and fill up the measuring cup with water. Skim the impurities and dunk the skimmer in the water to clean. Repeat until the broth is clean.\nTip #6: Add two cubes of curry roux at a time\nMake sure all the curry roux cubes are dissolved completely. You don’t want to bite into a chunk of curry cube while eating!\nFill up a ladle with broth and add two cubes. Using a spoon or chopsticks, let the roux dissolve completely. Then, add two more cubes and repeat.\nTip #7: Watch out when simmering curry\nAlways watch the curry after you add the roux. The thick curry sauce gets burnt easily at the bottom of the pot. \n\nNeed to simmer uncovered for 10 minutes after adding curry roux.\nUse low heat to simmer.\nStay in the kitchen, and keep stirring!\n\nTip #8: Make a big batch and store\nJapanese curry is ideal for freezing. I often cook up a big batch of leftovers and keep them in the refrigerator for a few days or in the freezer for up to a month.\nOh, one more thing! Starches like potatoes and sweet potatoes will change their texture after freezing, so remove them if you plan to freeze the curry.\n\nMake Japanese Curry in a Pressure Cooker\nDo you own an Instant Pot or a pressure cooker? You can also prepare this comfort dish using my Instant Pot (Pressure Cooker) Japanese Curry recipe.\nWhat to Serve with Japanese Curry \n\nWe typically serve the Japanese curry over rice alongside fukujinzuke, a relish made of finely chopped vegetables such as daikon, eggplant, and lotus root, pickled in a soy sauce-based liquid. It will warm you right up! \nI hope you enjoy this delicious Japanese Chicken Curry recipe!\nMore Delicious Japanese Curry Recipes\n\n\nJapanese Beef Curry\nInstant Pot Japanese Curry\nCurry Udon\nKatsu Curry\nCold Curry Udon\n\nWish to learn more about Japanese cooking?\xa0Sign up for our\xa0free\xa0newsletter\xa0to receive cooking tips & recipe\xa0updates!

Please read my blog post on the “secret ingredient” we add to the curry. For this recipe, I add ginger, garlic, apple, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup. To Prepare the IngredientsCut 2 onions into wedges. I like to have the texture of the onions in my curry, so I cut them into thick wedges. If you prefer, you can mince or thinly slice the onions so they disintegrate into the sauce. Peel 2 carrots and cut them into rolling wedges (it‘s called rangiri in Japanese). This type of cut creates more surface area, which helps the carrots absorb more flavor and cook faster. Peel 3 Yukon gold potatoes and cut them into quarters. Soak them in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch. Tip: Yukon gold potatoes hold their shape well. You can use russet potatoes, but they tend to disintegrate into the broth during cooking, so cut them into 6 pieces each and add to the pot toward the end of cooking. Grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and measure 1 tsp ginger with the juice. Set aside. Mince 2 cloves garlic and set aside (I use a garlic press later when adding to the pot). Cut ½ apple into quarters, remove the core, and peel the skin. Grate the apple and set aside. Note: You also could use 1 small lunchbox apple for 8 servings. Cut off the extra fat from 1½ lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs and discard it. Then, cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. I recommend cutting it diagonally (it‘s called sogigiri in Japanese) to create more surface area and flatten each piece so it cooks faster. Season with freshly ground black pepper. Tip: If you will use homemade curry roux, you can lightly season the chicken with kosher salt as well. To Cook the CurryHeat 1½ Tbsp neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion.  Sauté the onions, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Don‘t stir the onions too often because they won’t develop a golden color. Cooked onions add amazing flavor, so we do not want to skip this step. If you have an extra 5 minutes, definitely caramelize the onions! Add the minced garlic (I pass it through a garlic press for a finer texture) and grated ginger and mix well together. Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it‘s no longer pink on the outside. If the onions are getting too brown, reduce the heat to medium low temporarily. Add 4 cups chicken stock/broth. To reduce the sodium, you can substitute with water only or use half stock and half water, if you prefer. Tip: If you‘re using my homemade curry roux, you don‘t need to worry as it does not contain salt. Add the grated apple, 1 Tbsp honey, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp ketchup (or any condiment you choose to add). Please read my blog post for details. Add the carrots and Yukon gold potatoes (if you‘re using russet potatoes, add them later in the last 15–20 minutes of cooking). The broth should barely cover the ingredients. Don‘t worry; we don‘t want too much liquid here, and additional liquid will be released from the meat and vegetables. Simmer, covered*, on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. *Simmer uncovered if the ingredients are completely submerged in the broth. Once boiling, use a fine-mesh strainer to\xa0skim the scum and foam\xa0from the surface of the broth. Continue to cook covered until a wooden skewer goes through the carrots and potatoes. To Add the Curry RouxTurn off the heat. From 1 package Japanese curry roux, put 1–2 cubes in a ladleful of cooking liquid. Slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks and stir into the pot to incorporate. Repeat with the rest of the blocks, 2 cubes at a time. Tip: I use 1 full-sized box of store-bought curry roux, which is typically for 8–12 servings (be careful, as some brands offer a smaller box, which is 4 servings). With my homemade curry roux, I typically use 6–7 cubes for 8 servings (about 80% of the curry roux mixture if it hasn‘t solidified yet). Simmer, uncovered, on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the curry becomes thick, about 5–10 minutes. If your curry is too thick, you can add water to thin the sauce. When you stir, make sure that no roux or food is stuck to the bottom of the pot; otherwise, it may burn. If you use my unsalted homemade curry roux, taste the curry now and add salt to your liking. Tip: I recommend adding 2–4 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, but this will vary based on the brand of the chicken broth and condiments you added. To ServeServe the curry with steamed Japanese short-grain rice on the side. If you like, garnish with fukujinzuke (Japanese red pickled vegetables).  To StoreYou can keep the leftovers in a glass airtight container (so no stains!) and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and in the freezer for a month. The texture of the potatoes will change in the freezer, so you should take them out before freezing. Defrost the frozen curry in the refrigerator for 24 hours before you want to reheat it. To ReheatLeftover curry sauce will thicken into a paste as it cools, so it tends to burn while reheating. To avoid this, stir ½ cup (120 ml) water or more into the leftover sauce until loosened. Then, gently reheat it on low heat. If the sauce seems thin, continue heating with the lid off to reduce the sauce.\nNotesSubstitutions: You can substitute the chicken with beef, pork, shrimp, seafood, tofu, mushrooms, and other vegetables. Since tofu, mushrooms, and vegetables cook quickly, you may not need to simmer them for 15 minutes, except for dense root vegetables like carrots and potatoes here. You can sauté mushrooms and softer vegetables (squash, zucchini, eggplant, etc.) and simmer for 5 minutes or until tender. If you use tofu, you just need to warm it up as it’s is already fully cooked. I recommend draining tofu for 15 minutes prior to use and adding it right after you add the curry roux. Warm it up for the last 5–10 minutes.\nEquipmentsmall potDutch ovenchef's knifewooden skewerschopsticksapple peeler\nNutritionCalories: 576 kcal · Carbohydrates: 81 g · Protein: 25 g · Fat: 18 g · Saturated Fat: 8 g · Polyunsaturated Fat: 2 g · Monounsaturated Fat: 6 g · Trans Fat: 0.4 g · Cholesterol: 107 mg · Sodium: 521 mg · Potassium: 778 mg · Fiber: 6 g · Sugar: 10 g · Vitamin A: 4418 IU · Vitamin C: 21 mg · Calcium: 91 mg · Iron: 6 mg\n\nAuthor: Namiko Hirasawa Chen\nCourse: Main CourseCuisine: JapaneseKeyword: curry roux, japanese curry\n\n\n©JustOneCookbook.com Content and photographs are copyright protected.

Tender pieces of chicken, carrots, and potatoes cooked in a rich, savory curry\xa0sauce, this Japanese version of curry is a must-have for your family meal.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nThis may come as a surprise, but \nJapanese Curry,\xa0aka Curry Rice (Kare Raisu, カレーライス),\n is an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan. I grew up on curry rice, as my mom would make it as frequently as I can recall. \n\n\nThe bite-sized chunks of meat, the thick-cut vegetables, the rich and creamy brown curry sauce, and the fluffy rice make every bite so comforting and exciting. Not only is it a meal that’s easy to make on busy nights, but it also tastes better on the second day. \n\n\nSo, if you wish to master Japanese home cooking, you must add Japanese curry to your repertoire. Let me show you how to make \nJapanese Chicken Curry\n (チキンカレー) today!\n\n\nTable of contents\nWhat is Japanese Curry?\nHomemade Japanese Curry Roux\nSecret Ingredients – Personalize Your Curry\nMake Japanese Curry in a Pressure Cooker\nWhat to Serve with Japanese Curry\nMore Delicious Japanese Curry Recipes\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Japanese Curry? \n\n\nJapanese curry is a thick curry with a stew-like consistency and commonly includes protein, sweet onions, carrots, and potatoes. The sauce is thickened by a roux (a mixture of fat and flour and an addition of curry spices). \n\n\nYou can find many variations of Japanese curries, ranging from regions to households, but the most basic one uses chicken, which is the recipe I’m sharing here. \n\n\nDon’t miss my \nJapanese curry recipes roundup\n, which includes vegetarian curry and more!\n\n\nHistory of Japanese Curry\n\n\nCurry was introduced to Japan in the late 1800s by the British, and they were initially Western-style stews mixed with curry powder. The Japanese adapted curry to their own version, and ‘Curry Rice’ (Kare Raisu, カレーライス) was born soon after. By the 1950s, S&B Foods developed a convenient instant mix — known as curry roux — in block form so everyone could make curry rice easily at home.\n\n\nToday, curry has become a staple of the Japanese home and is widely available in restaurants and food halls in departmental stores. The popularity extends beyond Japan; you can find its presence in many other Asian countries. \n\n\nWhat Makes Japanese Curry Different from Other Curries\n\n\nJapanese curry is quite different from most other curries worldwide\xa0— it has a thicker consistency, and the taste leans on the sweet and savory side. \nThe unique sweetness comes from onions, carrots, and other additions like honey and grated apples. \n\n\nThe sauce resembles a rich, thick demi-glace layered with spices and earthy flavors. Some would describe Japanese curry more like a hearty stew than a typical curry like Thai or Indian. It isn’t spicy, so it is suitable for children.\n\n\nIt’s also served with \nJapanese short-grain rice\n, which is sticker than basmati rice or long-grain rice. The rice grains also soak up the curry. \n\n\n\n\nThe Base Flavor – Japanese Curry Roux\n\n\nThe reason why we can make Japanese curry in a short time is that we use the convenient \nJapanese Curry Sauce Mix\n (curry roux カレールー) that comes in a box. The curry roux imparts a unique depth of aromatic spice flavor and creaminess to the dish. I’m not a big fan of “instant” or boxed food, but I have to say Japanese Curry Roux is an exception!\n\n\n\n\nSpice Level\n\n\nEach brand of curry roux usually comes with three levels of spiciness — Mild, Medium, or Hot. Since these are packaged for Japanese taste, the hot level is not nearly as spicy as Thai or Indian curry.\n\n\nToo Salty?\n\n\nSome of you may find the pre-boxed curry roux salty, and I agree. It does have a strong (salty) taste, which is why it goes well with plain steamed rice. The Japanese palate, in general, is gravitated to salty, savory foods. \n\n\nHere are my suggestions:\n\n\n\n\nMake my \nhomemade curry roux\n.\n\n\nUse water or half water half chicken stock instead of all chicken stock (because the saltiness of the stock varies).\n\n\nUse less curry roux.\n\n\nAdd more water to dilute the roux,\n but \nnote that the curry sauce will be more watery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomemade Japanese Curry Roux\n\n\nAlthough the boxed stuff may spare you some time in the kitchen, you’ll be surprised at how easy it is to make your own Japanese Curry Roux at home. And just like all curries, curry roux is best made from scratch. What are the other good reasons for homemade roux?\n\n\n\n\nNo MSG, artificial flavors, or other food additives are commonly found in boxed mixes.\n\n\nYou can customize the flavor, spice level, salt level, and thickness.\n\n\nYou can also make it gluten-free or vegetarian/vegan-friendly. \n\n\n\n\nIf you decide to \nmake the Curry Roux from scratch\n, it only takes 30 minutes. Click \nhere\n for the recipe.\n\n\n\n\nSecret Ingredients – Personalize Your Curry\n\n\nMy mom always adds some grated apples and different condiments to the curry. She says, “If you use just the boxed curry roux, your curry will always taste the same. It will not be different from your neighbor’s curry.”\n\n\nSo she taught me two tricks. 1) \nUse two\n different brands of curry roux\xa0– you can even mix the spice levels, like mild and medium spicy. 2) \nUse additional seasonings\n.\n\n\nMy mom and I would use a few combinations of the following ingredients to enhance the flavor and give some complexity to the curry. \n\n\n\n\n* \nBold\n items are our frequently used condiments.\n\n\n* Use \n1-3 tsp\n of secret ingredients to start. These are supposed to be “secret” ingredients and you don’t need to add a lot of it.\n\n\n* Add the secret ingredients \nwith the broth/water\n and cook together.\n\n\n\n\nSweet Taste\n\n\n\n\nChutney\n\n\nGrated apple\n\n\nHoney\n (Amylase in honey breaks starch and causes viscosity loss; therefore, add honey with broth and cook it. Do not add it after the curry roux as the curry will become watery.)\n\n\nKetchup\n\n\nMashed banana\n\n\nMirin\n\n\nOrange/Apricot jam\n\n\n\n\nRefreshing/Sour Taste\n\n\n\n\nLemon (Add right before serving)\n\n\nTomato\n\n\nYogurt\n\n\n\n\nSpicy Taste\n\n\n\n\nRed chili pepper\n\n\nBlack pepper\n\n\nCayenne pepper\n\n\n\n\nFragrance\n\n\n\n\nCumin\n\n\nBay leaf\n\n\nCinnamon \n\n\nCurry leaves\n\n\n\n\nUmami and Depth\n\n\n\n\nButter (Add with roux)\n\n\nChocolate (Add with roux)\n\n\nGarlic\n \ncloves\n (Add while sauteeing)\n\n\nFresh ginger\n (Add while sauteeing)\n\n\nInstant coffee\n\n\nMilk\n (Add with roux)\n\n\nOyster sauce\n\n\nRed wine\n\n\nSake\n\n\nSoy sauce\n\n\nTonkatsu sauce\n \nor\xa0Worcestershire Sauce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8 Helpful Tips to Make Japanese Chicken Curry\n\n\nTip #1: Cut ingredients into uniform shape\n\n\nThis helps to cook everything evenly at the same time. \n\n\n\n\nChicken:\n I recommend a Japanese cutting technique called \nsogigiri\n (そぎ切り), which slices the ingredient at an angle for more surface area.\n\n\nOnions:\n I cut into thick wedges for additional texture.\n\n\nCarrots:\n It takes time to cook carrots, so I recommend another Japanese cutting technique called rangiri (乱切り), which is a rotating cut. You rotate the ingredients as you cut. This creates a more open surface.\n\n\nPotatoes:\n I recommend Yukon gold potatoes for curry if you prefer to keep the potato shape in the final presentation. Russet potatoes tend to get dissolved by the end of cooking. Cut into 2 inches (5 cm) size, which is ideal. \n\n\n\n\nTip #2: Cook the onion till tender and golden\n\n\nThe nicely browned onions add a ton of flavor to the final curry. If you have an additional 5-10 minutes, caramelize the onion.\n\n\nTip #3: Cover the ingredients with just enough broth (or water)\n\n\nWhen you add the broth/water, be sure the ingredients are covered with enough water and not submerged completely. The “barely covering” situation is called \nhita hita\n (ひたひた) in Japanese. The ingredients will release more moisture into the cooking liquid as you simmer.\n\n\nTip #4: Add “Secret Ingredients” to the broth\n\n\nAdd your ‘secret ingredients’ with the broth before you bring everything to a simmer, before adding the curry roux. \n\n\nTip #5: Do not forget to skim\n\n\nSkimming is a significant step in Japanese cooking. We skim the scum and impurities to achieve a refined taste.\n\n\nGet a \nfine mesh skimmer\n and fill up the measuring cup with water. Skim the impurities and dunk the skimmer in the water to clean. Repeat until the broth is clean.\n\n\nTip #6: Add two cubes of curry roux at a time\n\n\nMake sure all the curry roux cubes are dissolved completely. You don’t want to bite into a chunk of curry cube while eating!\n\n\nFill up a ladle with broth and add two cubes. Using a spoon or chopsticks, let the roux dissolve completely. Then, add two more cubes and repeat.\n\n\nTip #7: Watch out when simmering curry\n\n\nAlways watch the curry after you add the roux. The thick curry sauce gets burnt easily at the bottom of the pot. \n\n\n\n\nNeed to simmer \nuncovered\n for 10 minutes after adding curry roux.\n\n\nUse \nlow heat\n to simmer.\n\n\nStay in the kitchen, and keep stirring!\n\n\n\n\nTip #8: Make a big batch and store\n\n\nJapanese curry is ideal for freezing. I often cook up a big batch of leftovers and keep them in the refrigerator for a few days or in the freezer for up to a month.\n\n\nOh, one more thing! Starches like potatoes and sweet potatoes will change their texture after freezing, so \nremove \nthem if you plan to freeze the curry.\n\n\n\n\nMake Japanese Curry in a Pressure Cooker\n\n\nDo you own an Instant Pot or a pressure cooker? You can also prepare this comfort dish using my \nInstant Pot (Pressure Cooker) Japanese Curry\n recipe.\n\n\nWhat to Serve with Japanese Curry \n\n\n\n\nWe typically serve the Japanese curry over rice alongside \nfukujinzuke\n, a relish made of finely chopped vegetables such as daikon, eggplant, and lotus root, pickled in a soy sauce-based liquid. It will warm you right up! \n\n\nI hope you enjoy this delicious Japanese Chicken Curry recipe!\n\n\nMore Delicious Japanese Curry Recipes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJapanese Beef Curry\n\n\nInstant Pot Japanese Curry\n\n\nCurry Udon\n\n\nKatsu Curry\n\n\nCold Curry Udon\n\n\n\n\nWish to learn more about Japanese cooking?\xa0\nSign up for our\n\xa0free\xa0\nnewsletter\n\xa0to receive cooking tips & recipe\xa0updates!

Please read my blog post on the “secret ingredient” we add to the curry. For this recipe, I add ginger, garlic, apple, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup.\n \nTo Prepare the Ingredients\nCut \n2 onions\n into wedges. I like to have the texture of the onions in my curry, so I cut them into thick wedges. If you prefer, you can mince or thinly slice the onions so they disintegrate into the sauce.\n \nPeel \n2 carrots\n and cut them into rolling wedges (it‘s called \nrangiri\n in Japanese). This type of cut creates more surface area, which helps the carrots absorb more flavor and cook faster.\n \nPeel \n3 Yukon gold potatoes\n and cut them into quarters. Soak them in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch. \nTip:\n Yukon gold potatoes hold their shape well. You can use russet potatoes, but they tend to disintegrate into the broth during cooking, so cut them into 6 pieces each and add to the pot toward the end of cooking.\n \nGrate the ginger (I use a \nceramic grater\n) and measure \n1 tsp ginger\n with the juice. Set aside. Mince \n2 cloves garlic\n and set aside (I use a garlic press later when adding to the pot).\n \nCut \n½ apple\n into quarters, remove the core, and peel the skin.\n \nGrate the apple and set aside. \nNote:\n You also could use \n1\n small lunchbox apple for \n8\n servings.\n \nCut off the extra fat from \n1½ lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n and discard it. Then, cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. I recommend cutting it diagonally (it‘s called \nsogigiri\n in Japanese) to create more surface area and flatten each piece so it cooks faster. Season with \nfreshly ground black pepper\n. \nTip:\n If you will use homemade curry roux, you can lightly season the chicken with kosher salt as well.\n \nTo Cook the Curry\nHeat \n1½ Tbsp neutral oil\n in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion. \n \nSauté the onions, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Don‘t stir the onions too often because they won’t develop a golden color. Cooked onions add amazing flavor, so we do not want to skip this step. If you have an extra 5 minutes, definitely caramelize the onions!\n \nAdd the minced garlic (I pass it through \na garlic press\n for a finer texture) and grated ginger and mix well together.\n \nAdd the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it‘s no longer pink on the outside. If the onions are getting too brown, reduce the heat to medium low temporarily.\n \nAdd \n4 cups chicken stock/broth\n. To reduce the sodium, you can substitute with \nwater only\n or use \nhalf stock and half water\n, if you prefer. \nTip:\n If you‘re using my homemade curry roux, you don‘t need to worry as it does not contain salt.\n \nAdd the grated apple, \n1 Tbsp honey\n, \n1 Tbsp soy sauce\n, and \n1 Tbsp ketchup\n (or any condiment you choose to add). Please read my blog post for details.\n \nAdd the carrots and Yukon gold potatoes (if you‘re using russet potatoes, add them later in the last 15–20 minutes of cooking). The broth should \nbarely cover\n the ingredients. Don‘t worry; we don‘t want too much liquid here, and additional liquid will be released from the meat and vegetables.\n \nSimmer, \ncovered*\n, on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. *Simmer \nuncovered\n if\n \nthe ingredients are completely submerged in the broth.\n \nOnce boiling, use a \nfine-mesh strainer\n to\xa0\nskim the scum and foam\n\xa0from the surface of the broth.\n \nContinue to cook covered until a wooden skewer goes through the carrots and potatoes.\n \nTo Add the Curry Roux\nTurn off the heat. From \n1 package Japanese curry roux\n, put 1–2 cubes in a ladleful of cooking liquid. Slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks and stir into the pot to incorporate. Repeat with the rest of the blocks, 2 cubes at a time. \nTip:\n I use 1 full-sized box of store-bought curry roux, which is typically for 8–12 servings (be careful, as some brands offer a smaller box, which is 4 servings). With my \nhomemade curry roux\n, I typically use 6–7 cubes for 8 servings (about 80% of the curry roux mixture if it hasn‘t solidified yet).\n \nSimmer, \nuncovered\n, on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the curry becomes thick, about \n5–10 minutes\n. If your curry is too thick, you can add water to thin the sauce. When you stir, make sure that no roux or food is stuck to the bottom of the pot; otherwise, it may burn.\n \nIf you use my unsalted \nhomemade curry roux\n, taste the curry now and add salt to your liking. \nTip: \nI recommend adding \n2–4\n tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, but this will vary based on the brand of the chicken broth and condiments you added.\n \nTo Serve\nServe the curry with steamed Japanese short-grain rice on the side. If you like, garnish with \nfukujinzuke (Japanese red pickled vegetables)\n. \n \nTo Store\nYou can keep the leftovers in a glass airtight container (so no stains!) and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and in the freezer for a month. The texture of the potatoes will change in the freezer, so you should take them out before freezing. Defrost the frozen curry in the refrigerator for 24 hours before you want to reheat it. \nTo Reheat\nLeftover curry sauce will thicken into a paste as it cools, so it tends to burn while reheating. To avoid this, stir ½ cup (120 ml) water or more into the leftover sauce until loosened. Then, gently reheat it on low heat. If the sauce seems thin, continue heating with the lid off to reduce the sauce.\n\n\nNotes\nSubstitutions:\n You can substitute the chicken with \nbeef\n, \npork\n, shrimp, \nseafood\n, tofu, mushrooms, and other \nvegetables\n. \nSince tofu, mushrooms, and vegetables cook quickly, you may not need to simmer them for 15 minutes, except for dense root vegetables like carrots and potatoes here. You can sauté mushrooms and softer vegetables (squash, zucchini, eggplant, etc.) and simmer for 5 minutes or until tender. If you use tofu, you just need to warm it up as it’s is already fully cooked. I recommend draining tofu for 15 minutes prior to use and adding it right after you add the curry roux. Warm it up for the last 5–10 minutes.\n\n\nEquipment\nsmall pot\nDutch oven\nchef's knife\nwooden skewers\nchopsticks\napple peeler\n\n\nNutrition\nCalories: \n576\n \nkcal\n · \nCarbohydrates: \n81\n \ng\n · \nProtein: \n25\n \ng\n · \nFat: \n18\n \ng\n · \nSaturated Fat: \n8\n \ng\n · \nPolyunsaturated Fat: \n2\n \ng\n · \nMonounsaturated Fat: \n6\n \ng\n · \nTrans Fat: \n0.4\n \ng\n · \nCholesterol: \n107\n \nmg\n · \nSodium: \n521\n \nmg\n · \nPotassium: \n778\n \nmg\n · \nFiber: \n6\n \ng\n · \nSugar: \n10\n \ng\n · \nVitamin A: \n4418\n \nIU\n · \nVitamin C: \n21\n \nmg\n · \nCalcium: \n91\n \nmg\n · \nIron: \n6\n \nmg\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nNamiko Hirasawa Chen\n\n\nCourse: \nMain Course\nCuisine: \nJapanese\nKeyword: \ncurry roux, japanese curry\n\n\n\n\n\n©JustOneCookbook.com Content and photographs are copyright protected.

As stated, this recipe essentially produces boiled chicken, as it has no time to develop the tasty crust derived from frying.\n\n\nOtherwise, this is a great meal.

I cannot wait to try to do it next time with homemade fukujinzuke and curry roux. Thank you a lot, it was easy to make it perfectly 🤗\n\nP.S. : also thank you for adding the possibility to choose the metric quantities, it helps a lot and saves time for someone from France\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Naomi (JOC Community Manager)\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reply to\xa0\n    \n\n        Victoria\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    2 months ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi, Victoria!

Example format: {"title": "Meal Title", "description": "Description of the meal", "recipes": [{"title": "Recipe Title", "description": "Description of the recipe", "ingredients": [{"name": "ingredient1", "amount": "1", "unit": "cup"}, {"name": "ingredient2", "amount": "2", "unit": "tbsp"}], "method": ["Step 1", "Step 2"]}]} '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYosenabe (Japanese Hot Pot) 寄せ鍋 • Just One Cookbook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse of this website is subject to mandatory arbitration and other terms and conditions, select \nthis link\n to read those agreements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to content\nJust One Cookbook\n Browse Ad Free with JOC PLUS!\nAll Recipes\n\n\nQuick & Easy\n\n\nMain Dishes\n\n\nDesserts\n\n\nPantry\n\n\nTravel\n\n\nAbout\n\n\nRecipe Filter\n\n\nRecipe Index\n\n\nReaders’ Favorites\n\n\nCourse\n\n\nSubmenu\n\n\nAppetizers\n\n\nBeverages\n\n\nBreakfast\n\n\nDesserts\n\n\nMain Dishes\n\n\nSalads\n\n\nSide Dishes\n\n\nSnacks\n\n\nSoups + Stews\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngredient\n\n\nSubmenu\n\n\nBeef\n\n\nChicken\n\n\nEggs\n\n\nNoodle + Pasta\n\n\nPork\n\n\nRice\n\n\nSeafood + Fish\n\n\nTofu\n\n\nVegetable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nSubmenu\n\n\nWeeknight\n\n\nBento\n\n\nGrill + Smoke\n\n\nHot Pot\n\n\nIzakaya\n\n\nMeal Prep\n\n\nPressure Cooker\n\n\nQuick & Easy\n\n\nStir-Fry\n\n\nSushi + Sashimi\n\n\nUnder 20 Minutes\n\n\nUnder 30 Minutes\n\n\nUnder 5 Ingredients\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDietary\n\n\nSubmenu\n\n\nGluten-Free\n\n\nVegan\n\n\nVegan/Vegetarian Adaptable\n\n\nVegetarian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow-Tos\n\n\nSubmenu\n\n\nCooking Tips\n\n\nPantry Tips\n\n\nKitchen Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin\n\n\nAbout\n\n\nPantry\n\n\nCookbooks\n\n\nTravel\n\n\nCulture\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n \nHome\n » \nRecipes\n » \nSoups + Stews\n » \nYosenabe (Japanese Hot Pot) 寄せ鍋\nYosenabe (Japanese Hot Pot) 寄せ鍋\nJump to Recipe \n35\n minutes\n \nminutes\n 17 comments\n4.80\n from \n25\n votes\nAuthor:\n \nNamiko Hirasawa Chen\n Published: \n Dec 22, 2022 \n Updated: \n Oct 7, 2024 \n This post may contain affiliate links. Please read my \ndisclosure policy\n.\n\n\nYosenabe is a basic Japanese hot pot where you can cook whatever ingredients—chicken, seafood, tofu, and all kinds of vegetables—in a delicious dashi-based broth. \n\n\n\n\nLooking for a flexible hot pot recipe that can clean up leftover vegetables or meat in the freezer drawer? You’ll have to try \nYosenabe\n \n(寄せ鍋) or “Anything Goes” Hot Pot! This popular Japanese hot pot is a wintertime favorite to make at home because you can literally \nthrow in just about anything. It’s a warm, flavorful, and easy meal to boot. \n\n\nYou can keep things simple for a weeknight dinner, but with the addition of fresh seafood, yosenabe can easily be one of the most luxurious hot pots to serve at a gathering!\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWhat is Yosenabe?\nIngredients for Yosenabe\nHot Pot Cooking Tools\nCan I Use an Electric Hot Pot?\nHow To Cook Yosenabe At The Table\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Yosenabe?\n\n\nThe word \nyose \ncomes from the verb \nyoseru \n(寄せる) which means to “put together.” And \nnabe\n (鍋) is the Japanese word for “pot” and is used to refer to hot pot dishes. So yosenabe is pretty much an “everything hot pot” where you have all kinds of ingredients cooked together in a simmering broth for an ultimate warm meal.\n\n\nI also call yosenabe a freestyle hot pot because there is no right or wrong way to make it. You start with a simple dashi broth, then add in your choice of proteins, followed by fresh vegetables and mushrooms. For yosenabe, the more the merrier. The mix of ingredients will lend plenty of flavor to the soup broth! \n\n\n\n\nIngredients for Yosenabe\n\n\nSince we cook yosenabe at the table, the only things you have to prepare are:\n\n\n\n\nMeat\n: chicken tender, but can be chicken thighs or any other meat you enjoy\n\n\nSeafood\n: sablefish, shrimp, and Manila clams, but scallops and mussels work fine too\n\n\nVegetables\n: napa cabbage, chrysanthemum leaves, carrot, and negi\n\n\nMushrooms\n: shiitake, shimeji, and enoki mushrooms\n\n\nTofu\n: medium firm tofu\n\n\nBroth\n: awase dashi (kombu + katsuobushi broth)\n\n\nSeasonings\n: sake, mirin, soy sauce, and salt\n\n\nGarnish\n: green onion, yuzu zest, and shichimi togarashi\n\n\n\n\nHot Pot Cooking Tools\n\n\n\n\nA large donabe \n(Japanese earthenware pot) – You can also use a large Dutch oven. I have different styles of donabe and for this recipe, I used \nGinpo Kikka Banko Donabe Japanese Clay Pot\n. If you love hot pot dishes (shabu shabu, sukiyaki, kimchi nabe, etc.), it’s a great kitchen tool to have!\n\n\nA portable stove\n – I use this \nIwatani butane gas stove\n. It is a necessary tool to enjoy all kinds of hot pots at home.\n\n\nCommunal cooking tools\n – Long cooking chopsticks, slotted spoons, ladles, and a fine-mesh skimmer.\n\n\n\n\nCan I Use an Electric Hot Pot?\n\n\nWhile I prefer using a donabe to make Yosenabe, you can also use an electric hot pot to make this dish. I own the highly reviewed \nZojirushi Gourmet d’Expert Electric Skillet\n, which you can get for \n$159 at Amazon\n. I use it as both a hot pot and a skillet and it’s great for serving a big group. That’s why it earned my top pick in my roundup of \nelectric hot pots\n!\n\n\n\n\nMirin and Sake I Recommend\n\n\nTo flavor the soup broth, you will need mirin and sake. Just like soy sauce, these two condiments are frequently used in Japanese recipes. It’s very important to use mirin with a higher % of alcohol, and not a mirin-like or mirin-type condiment (\nread more about different kinds of mirin\n).\n\n\nSake is almost always used whenever we make seafood and meat recipes as the alcohol masks the fishy/gamey smell while imparting sweet natural umami from the fermented rice wine.\n\n\nI’ve been using\xa0\nSho Chiku Bai Classic Junmai\n\xa0and\xa0\nTakara Mirin\n\xa0by \nTakara Sake\n for a long time.\xa0And I’m glad that I get to partner with the company to introduce the trusted Japanese ingredients to elevate your cooking!\n\n\n\n\nYou can purchase \nSho Chiku Bai Classic Junmai\n\xa0and\xa0\nTakara Mirin\n at Japanese grocery stores, Asian grocery stores, and some local supermarkets. \n\n\n\n\nHow To Cook Yosenabe At The Table\n\n\nStep 1: Set up the table\n\n\nIn the center of the table, set up a portable stove for the hot pot. Make sure everyone can reach the pot; otherwise, I recommend setting up more than one stove and pot. It’s not fun when you sit too far from the hot pot action.\n\n\nPlace the platters of ingredients around the portable stove. They should be easily accessible to everyone.\n\n\nStep 2: Bring the broth to a boil\n\n\nFirst, bring the broth to a boil. If you are cooking root vegetables such as daikon, gobo (burdock root), and carrots (if not ribbons, as I did in this recipe), start cooking them while you are heating up the broth. They take a longer time to cook. \n\n\nStep 3: \xa0Fill the pot with ingredients but do not overcrowd\n\n\nOnce the broth is boiling, add the ingredients to the pot by arranging them in sections until the pot is filled. For example, keep the napa cabbage in one area, while the mushrooms stay in one area and the seafood stays in another. This way, it’s easy to pick up the food you want to eat.\n\n\nAlways remember—do not overcrowd as we will cook and eat in batches. Hot pot is a process, so space out the cooking so you can enjoy the food at a leisurely pace.\n\n\nClose the lid and cook for 8-10 minutes. Depending on the ingredients, leafy greens will cook a lot faster than chicken, so keep an eye out for the food. During the waiting period, everyone can enjoy any appetizers or side dishes that are served alongside the hot pot. \n\n\nStep 4: Serve the cooked food\n\n\nIt’s always a nice gesture to pick up food from the pot for people sitting next to you who may be busy chatting or eating. Ask if they are interested in being served. \n\n\nEnjoy the food while hot. For yosenabe, the ingredients are already cooked in a flavorful broth, so there’s no need for a dipping sauce. We sprinkle chopped green onion, yuzu zest, and/or shichimi togarashi to enjoy.\n\n\nStep 5: Start a new batch\n\n\nOnce all the cooked food is served and cleared from the hot pot, add a new batch of ingredients. Cover the lid and start cooking for another 8-10 minutes. Add water if the broth is low in the pot. Enjoy and continue with 2-3 more rounds of cooking until you finish all the ingredients. \n\n\n\n\nSake Pairing with Mio \n\n\nFor yosenabe, we’ve paired it with Takara Sake’s \nSho Chiku Bai Shirakabegura Mio.\n It is one of our favorite sake drinks to share with friends and enjoy during celebrations. \n\n\n\n\nIf you’ve never tried sparkling sake before, we would highly recommend trying Mio as the first one. It is made from just rice and koji rice with no additives. The profile is slightly sweet, fruity, and very refreshing. Many of our friends were surprised how delicious it tastes and became instant fans. Its tiny bubbles are similar in texture to a fine champagne and contains a low 5% alcohol compared to regular sakes.\n\n\nThe gentle characters of Mio complement yosenabe’s bold savory flavors superbly. Drinking the sparkling sake while eating hot pot brings out the unique flavors of each ingredient, and Mio ends up tasting a bit sweeter with the savory foods. The best part is the cold sparkling sake cools you down and encourage the appetite to eat more hot pot!\n\n\n\n\nWish to learn more about Japanese cooking?\xa0\nSign up for our\n\xa0free\xa0\nnewsletter\n\xa0to receive cooking tips & recipe\xa0updates!

Cover and bring it to a simmer, and then turn off the heat. Set aside.\n \nTo Prepare Ingredients\nGather all the ingredients. Yosenabe is pretty flexible and you can substitute any of the listed ingredients with whatever you have or want to eat.\n \nShrimp:\n Devein shrimp by following \nthis instruction\n. Insert the tip of the skewer sideways about ½ inch (1.3 cm) down from the head of the shrimp (whether it's a shell on or off) and pull the skewer tip up towards you. This will lift up the vein and you can pull it off with the skewer or with your hand. If the vein is broken, then insert again a bit lower towards the tail. If you can’t find the vein, then don’t worry about it.\n \nChicken tender:\n To remove the tendon, firmly grab the end of the tendon (maybe use a paper towel to increase grip) and place the knife on top of the tendon as you see in the image below. Using the knife to hold the chicken in place, pull the end of the tendon as you push the chicken away. Repeat with the rest of the chicken tenders. Then hold your knife diagonally, nearly parallel to the cutting board, and then slice the tender. This cutting method gives it more surface area so that it cooks faster and soaks up flavor quickly. This cutting technique is called \nsogigiri\n in Japanese.\n \nFish:\n Cut the fish fillets in half. Place all the seafood ingredients on a platter.\n \nNapa cabbage:\n Remove the core, separate the leaves, and rinse them carefully. Then cut them into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces.\n \nCut the tough bottom part of the leaves into smaller strips/pieces.\n \nChrysanthemum leaves: \nCut them into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces. \nNegi:\n Cut it diagonally into ½-inch (1.3 cm) pieces.\n \nCarrot:\n Using a vegetable peeler, peel the carrot into thin ribbons. Place all the vegetables on another platter.\n \nEnoki mushrooms: \nDiscard the bottom and cut into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces. \nShimeji mushrooms:\n Discard the bottom and separate them.\n \nShiitake mushrooms:\n Discard the bottom. If you like, you can curve the cap of shiitake mushrooms to make them look like a flower by following \nthis instruction\n.\n \nTofu:\n Cut it into smaller pieces. Place the mushrooms and tofu on another platter.\n \nGreen onion: \nCut it into small pieces for garnish.\n \nTo Cook Yosenabe\nBring the broth to a boil. If you are cooking root vegetables such as daikon, gobo (burdock root), and carrots (if not ribbons), start cooking them while you are heating up the broth. They take a longer time to cook. Once boiling, add various kinds of ingredients to the pot and arrange them by sections. For example, group the napa cabbage in one area, while mushrooms stay in one area and seafood in another. This way, you can choose what you want to eat. Close the lid and cook for \n8-10 minutes\n. Keep an eye on leafy greens. Dish them out early if they turn soft and ready to eat. \n \nPick up the cooked food and enjoy while they are hot. For yosenabe, the ingredients are cooked in a flavorful broth; therefore, we do not dip the cooked food in a dipping sauce like shabu shabu. We sprinkle chopped green onion, yuzu zest, and/or shichimi togarashi to enjoy.  \n \nOnce all the cooked ingredients are served and cleared from the hot pot, add a new batch of ingredients. Cover the lid and start cooking for 10 minutes. Add water if the broth is low in the pot.\nEnjoy and repeat 1-2 more rounds until you finish all the ingredients. \nTo Store\nYou can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store them in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.\n\n\nNutrition\nCalories: \n318\n \nkcal\n · \nCarbohydrates: \n20\n \ng\n · \nProtein: \n41\n \ng\n · \nFat: \n7\n \ng\n · \nSaturated Fat: \n1\n \ng\n · \nPolyunsaturated Fat: \n3\n \ng\n · \nMonounsaturated Fat: \n2\n \ng\n · \nTrans Fat: \n1\n \ng\n · \nCholesterol: \n78\n \nmg\n · \nSodium: \n1213\n \nmg\n · \nPotassium: \n1297\n \nmg\n · \nFiber: \n7\n \ng\n · \nSugar: \n8\n \ng\n · \nVitamin A: \n3310\n \nIU\n · \nVitamin C: \n53\n \nmg\n · \nCalcium: \n316\n \nmg\n · \nIron: \n4\n \nmg\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nNamiko Hirasawa Chen\n\n\nCourse: \nMain Course\nCuisine: \nJapanese\nKeyword: \nhot pot, seafood\n\n\n\n\n\n©JustOneCookbook.com Content and photographs are copyright protected.

Thank you very much for reading Nami’s post and trying her recipe!😊\n\nFor Nabe dishes like this one, we use Kombu to extract the flavor, so all the Kombus you listed are equally good. When we use the Kombu itself for the recipe, some Kombu gives a better texture to certain dishes, and we prefer one more than the other.\n\n\nhttps://www.justonecookbook.com/kombu/\n\nWe hope this helps!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Uyen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    2 years ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your wonderful recipes Nami.When I read your post,I can improve my reading skill too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Naomi (JOC Community Manager)\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reply to\xa0\n    \n\n        Uyen\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    2 years ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Uyen!

The dashi was simply soaked kombu, and I used boneess/skinless chicken breast, napa cabbage, carrotts, daikon radish and shitake mushrooms (and even carved the decoration onto the mushroom caps.) As my husband said, “Restaurant quality,” the flavor was so authentic. Because I try to limit too much sodium, we started out with a smaller portion of reduced sodium soy sauce, and then added a bit more at the table. The broth was so simple and flavorful. Perfect for a chilly winter night with a snowstorm on the horizon.

To finish, my homemade ravioli are tossed in a simple butter sauce and extra cheese to serve. It’s heaven on a plate!\n\n\nHomemade is unbeatable!\n\n\nIf you’ve always wanted to make homemade ravioli but thought it was too difficult, this is the recipe for you! I’ve included a comprehensive step by step process and lots of helpful hints to make the perfect \nSpinach Ricotta Ravioli\n. While this is a more complicated recipe, it’s not out of the reach of most home cooks.\xa0\n\n\nThis recipe is based on my family’s recipe for tortelli d’erbetta which is a classic filled pasta from my dad’s region of Emilia Romagna. It produces luscious and delicate ricotta ravioli with spinach that is sure to impress your friends and family. The spinach ricotta cheese filling is so velvety and loaded with flavor from the Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and freshly grated nutmeg.\xa0\n\n\nMy Spinach Ricotta Ravioli recipe is the perfect dish to celebrate special occasions and important milestones with your loved ones. In fact, this was the dish that marked all the memorable events in my childhood. I know that once you’ve made these homemade ravioli and created the same family memories, you’ll never use the store bought version again.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nToggle\n\n\nWhy you’ll love this recipe\nWhat is Ravioli?\nIngredients\xa0\nInstructions for Spinach Ricotta Filling\nInstructions for Pasta Dough\nInstructions to make ravioli\nSubstitutions\nVariations\nEquipment\nStorage\nTop tips\nFAQ\nServing Suggestions\nSpinach Ravioli Recipe with Ricotta\n\n\nWhy you’ll love this recipe\n\n\n\n\nTaste – these Spinach Ricotta Ravioli are filled with a flavorsome and creamy ricotta cheese mix. The slightly bitter spinach perfectly sets off the rich, creaminess of the ricotta.\n\n\nVersatile – the sauce to serve these Spinach Ricotta Ravioli is made simply with butter and Parmesan cheese but if your family loves tomato sauce that will work too. So will a basic olive oil, garlic and chilli sauce.\n\n\nNutritious – spinach is rich in iron, vitamins and minerals and pairs perfectly with ricotta which is high in calcium and a great source of other nutrients.\n\n\nNo fancy equipment – this recipe doesn’t require any fancy ravioli makers, just your trusty pasta machine and basic kitchen equipment.\n\n\nStep by step – This recipe will give you step by step instructions and all the tips needed to make these ricotta ravioli perfectly.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Ravioli?\n\n\nRavioli are Italian filled pasta that is usually square or circular in shape. The ingredients for fillings can vary from cheese, meat, vegetables, or a combination of any of these.\xa0 Even mushrooms like in my homemade \nmushroom ravioli\n.  \n\n\nTo make ravioli, pasta is rolled thinly and spoonfuls of the filling are placed in the middle. The pasta is folded over enclosing the filling and creating small stuffed pasta dumplings. Ravioli are usually boiled and then served with a sauce or in broth, all of which are very popular in Italy and around the world.\n\n\nDepending on the region of Italy, filled pasta can go by many other names. Some of these names include tortellini (like my \nTortellini alla Panna\n), \nFagottini\n, cappelletti, agnolotti, mezzelune and culurgiones.\n\n\nFor complete ingredient quantities and full instructions, please scroll to the printable recipe card at the bottom of the page.\n\n\nIngredients\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpinach – fresh spinach is my preference here.\xa0\n\n\nRicotta cheese – Beautiful fresh ricotta cheese makes a beautiful creamy filling and can be purchased at most supermarkets. Depending on where you live in the world, ricotta cheese can be expensive to buy, so for a more economical option, you can use my recipe for \nhomemade ricotta cheese\n.\xa0\n\n\nParmigiano Reggiano cheese – also known as Parmesan Cheese. For best results, buy a block of cheese and grate it freshly as needed. This adds a lovely savory flavor to the ravioli filling and also for serving.\xa0\xa0\n\n\nNutmeg – my preference is freshly grated nutmeg, but you could also use ground nutmeg.\n\n\n00 Flour – also known as doppio zero flour. It is finely ground flour and the best choice of flour for making homemade pasta dough.\xa0\n\n\nEggs – I prefer large free range eggs for this Spinach Ricotta Ravioli recipe.\xa0\n\n\nSemolina flour – this type of flour is made from coarsely ground durum wheat and is perfect for dusting and keeping the ravioli from sticking.\n\n\nButter – unsalted butter for serving the Spinach Ricotta Ravioli.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nSee recipe card for quantities.\n\n\nInstructions for Spinach Ricotta Filling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWash spinach then cook in a pan over medium until wilted. Cool and squeeze out excess moisture. Chop spinach finely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombine chopped spinach with the remaining filling ingredients. Refrigerate until needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: Don’t add any water to the pan to cook the spinach. The water clinging to the leaves after washing is enough.\n\n\nInstructions for Pasta Dough\n\n\nReserve a couple of tablespoons of flour. Tip the remaining flour onto the work surface and make a well in the middle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreak eggs into the well in the flour\nUsing a fork (or fingertips) whisk the eggs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGradually incorporate a little bit of flour into the eggs working into a scraggy dough.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnead the dough until it’s smooth. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm  into a ball then cover with a bowl or wrap in plastic and set aside to rest.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: For more step by step pasta dough instructions and photos, refer to my \nTagliatelle Pasta recipe\n.\n\n\nInstructions\n \nto make ravioli\n\n\nDivide pasta dough into 4 equal parts. Take one portion and cover the remaining dough. Use either a hand cranked pasta machine or stand mixer pasta attachment and set the pasta machine rollers at the widest setting. Prepare large baking sheets lined with parchment paper that has been dusted with semolina flour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPass the dough through the rollers. Fold and repeat until smooth. Reduce the roller width setting gradually, passing the dough through each time until 1/16 inch thick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace heaped teaspoons of filling (or use a piping bag) along the length half of the sheet, 1 inch apart. You should have 7-8 mounds. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFold the opposing long edge of pasta over the filling to cover. Press to seal.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCut into squares with a pastry wheel or a knife.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrange onto prepared baking sheets in a single layer. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCook the ravioli in lots of salted boiling water for 3 minutes. Drain then gently toss in butter sauce and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: Keep each mound of filling closer to the one long edge so that the other long edge can be folded over to seal. When pressing to seal, begin in the middle of the pasta sheet, and press around each mound expelling the air as you work your way towards each end. \n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\n\n\nSpinach – substitute silverbeet, swiss chard or collard greens for the spinach in this ravioli filling. You can also use frozen spinach, however, you will need to thaw it and drain out the liquid so that it doesn’t make your Spinach Ricotta Ravioli soggy.\xa0\n\n\nParmigiano Reggiano cheese – try pecorino romano instead. It will be saltier so be sure to adjust the seasoning.\n\n\nNutmeg – if you don’t have nutmeg or don’t like the flavor, you can just leave it out.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nVariations\n\n\n\n\nZesty – try adding some lemon zest to the ravioli filling for a fresh and fragrant flavor.\n\n\nGarlicky – add some minced garlic into the Spinach Ricotta Ravioli filling for extra punch.\n\n\nTomato sauce – serve these delicious homemade ravioli with my simple \nSan Marzano Tomato Sauce.\n\n\n\n\nEquipment\n\n\nWhile you can roll out pasta dough with just a rolling pin but a hand cranked pasta machine or attachment for the stand mixer will make it easier to make these homemade ravioli. The pasta machine ensures the homemade pasta is rolled out thinly enough.\xa0\n\n\nDon’t worry about buying fancy ravioli molds or ravioli makers. A fluted pastry pastry wheel will do the job just fine. You could even use a sharp knife if you don’t own a pastry wheel.\xa0\n\n\nStorage\n\n\nThese ricotta spinach ravioli are best enjoyed fresh. Arrange the homemade ravioli on a sheet pan that is lined with parchment paper and dusted with semolina flour to prevent sticking. To avoid soft or soggy ravioli, cook them within an hour of shaping them or pop them in the refrigerator if it’s going to be longer.\xa0\n\n\nYou can freeze these Spinach Ricotta Ravioli for up to one month. I recommend freezing the homemade ravioli in an airtight container with layers of parchment paper in between the layers to stop them from sticking.\n\n\nTop tips\n\n\n\n\nPreparation is the key to making homemade ravioli successfully! Declutter your workspace as you’ll need a large bench or table to shape the ricotta ravioli.\xa0\xa0\n\n\nIf you’re using store bought ricotta cheese, be sure to drain excess water from it. Don’t skip this step or the Spinach Ricotta filling will be too wet leaving you with soggy ravioli.\n\n\nTo make the perfect pasta dough and roll it out successfully, take a look at my \nTagliatelle Pasta\n recipe for some helpful hints.\n\n\nWhen shaping and assembling the ricotta ravioli be sure to gently smooth out the air bubbles using your fingers. Excess air trapped inside the sealed ravioli could cause the ravioli to open while they cook in the boiling water.\xa0\n\n\nTo avoid the Spinach Ricotta Ravioli from sticking, arrange on a baking sheet, lined with parchment paper and dusted with semolina flour. Ensure the ravioli do not touch or overlap as they will stick to each other.\xa0\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nWhat does ravioli mean in Italian?\n \nIn Italian, ravioli refers to the small envelopes of pasta containing a filling. Ravioli is plural and raviolo is one singular Italian filled pasta.\xa0\n \n \nHow to serve Spinach Ricotta Ravioli?\n \nI love to serve Spinach Ricotta Ravioli in a simple butter and Parmesan cheese sauce. However, you could also flavor the butter sauce with some fresh basil, fresh sage or minced garlic.\n \n \nIs spinach and ricotta ravioli healthy?\n \nI’m not a believer in diet culture and like to eat everything in moderation. For this reason, Spinach Ricotta Ravioli are healthy! Ricotta is rich in calcium and protein. Spinach, like all dark leafy greens, is full of nutrients. And homemade fresh pasta or homemade ravioli are much healthier than store bought because they don’t include any preservatives.\xa0\xa0\n \n \n\n\nServing Suggestions\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t like the simple butter ravioli sauce, you can serve these delicious Spinach Ricotta Ravioli in my \nSan Marzano Tomato Sauce\n or a tomato cream sauce instead. Alongside this delicious pasta dish, you can serve my \nSemolina Bread\n for dunking into the sauce and my \nMediterranean Cucumber Salad\n for some freshness.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpinach Ravioli Recipe with Ricotta\n\n\n\n\nThese delicate Italian ravioli are filled with rich, creamy ricotta, spinach, savory Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and a touch of nutmeg. To finish, my homemade ravioli are tossed in a simple butter sauce and extra cheese to serve. \n\n\n\n\n5\n from \n95\n votes\n\n\n\n\n Print\n\n\n Pin\n\n\n Review\n\n\n\n\nPrep Time: \n2\n hours\n \nhours\nCook Time: \n5\n minutes\n \nminutes\nResting Time: \n30\n minutes\n \nminutes\nTotal Time: \n2\n hours\n \nhours\n \n35\n minutes\n \nminutes\n\n\nServings:\n6\n \npeople\n\n\nAuthor: \nMarcellina\n\n\n\n\nEquipment\n▢ \n1 Skillet\n▢ \n1 Hand cranked pasta machine\n▢ \n1 Fluted cutting roller \noptional\n▢ \n1 Large saucepan\n▢ \n1 Small saucepan\n\n\nIngredients\nSpinach Ricotta Filling\n▢ \n8\n \nounces\n \nfresh spinach\n \n(\n226 grams\n)\n▢ \n1\n \npound\n \nfresh ricotta\n \n(\n450 grams\n)\n▢ \n4\n \nounces\n \nfinely grated Parmigiano Reggiano\n \n(\n120 grams\n)\n▢ \n1\n \negg\n▢ \n¼ – ½\n \nteaspoon\n \nground nutmeg\n▢ \n1\n \nteaspoon\n \nsalt\nPasta Dough\n▢ \n3 ⅓\n \ncups\n \n00 flour\n \n(\n400 grams/14 ounces\n) See Note 1\n▢ \n4\n \neggs\n \nat room temperature\n▢ \nSemolina flour for dusting\nTo Serve\n▢ \n4\n \nounces\n \nsalted butter\n \n(\n115\n grams)\n▢ \npinch\n \nsalt\n▢ \n2\n \nounces\n \nfinely grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese extra to serve\n \n(\n60\n grams)\n\n\nCook Mode\nPrevent your screen from going dark\n\n\nInstructions\nSpinach Ricotta Filling\nWash the spinach and wilt in a skillet over medium heat. There’s no need to add any extra water.\nCool and squeeze out excess moisture.\nChop spinach finely.\nCombine chopped spinach with the remaining filling ingredients.\nCover and refrigerate until ready to use.\nPasta Dough\nImportant\n – Reserve a few tablespoons of flour to the side. \nTip the remaining flour onto the work surface and make a well in the middle.\nBreak eggs into the well in the flour\nUsing a fork (or fingertips) whisk the eggs like you’re making scrambled eggs. As you whisk, bring in a little bit of flour from around the edges and incorporate it into the eggs.\nKeep working more flour into the dough. A pastry scraper is useful or just use your hands.\nAdd more flour as needed. The dough should not be sticky. If you are rolling by hand do not add too much flour. \nIf the pasta dough is too sticky, knead in a little more flour. If the pasta dough is dry and hard to knead, knead in a little water teaspoon by teaspoon. The more pasta dough you make, the more you'll be able to judge by the feel of the dough.\nKnead the dough for 8-10 minutes or until it is smooth and you feel the change in the dough. Don’t omit this kneading.\nPut an upturned bowl over the dough or wrap in plastic wrap and allow to rest for 30 minutes or so.\nAssemble the Ravioli\nLine large baking sheets with parchment paper then sprinkle with semolina flour. You may need 3 or 4 baking sheets.\nDivide pasta dough into 4 equal parts. Take one portion keeping the remaining dough covered.\nUse either a hand cranked pasta machine or pasta attachment for a stand mixer. Set the pasta machine with the rollers at the widest setting.\nFlatten the dough slightly then pass the dough through the rollers. Remaining on the widest setting, fold the dough and repeat until smooth. Dust with a little flour to prevent the dough from sticking and dragging through the rollers.\nReduce the roller width setting gradually, passing the dough through each time (or even twice) until the dough is about 1/16 inch in thickness. Or #6 on a KitchenAid pasta roller.\nThe pasta sheet should be at least 30 inches (75cm) long.\nLay the sheet onto a lightly floured surface. That could be your countertop, table or large cutting board. Cut the sheet in half to make two lengths of 15 inches (37.5cm) long. This will make it easier to fold over.\nPlace heaped teaspoons of filling (or use a piping bag) 1 inch (2 ½ cm) along each length of the pasta about ½ inch (a bit over 1cm) from the edge. You should have about 7 or 8 mounds on each sheet of pasta. Tip: Keep each mound closer to the one long edge so that the other long edge can be folded over to seal.\nFold the opposing long edge of pasta over the filling matching up the edges. Press around each mound of filling to seal. Tip: Begin in the middle of the pasta length working your way towards each end, press around each mound expelling the air as you go\nCut into squares with a fluted pastry wheel or a knife and arrange on the prepared baking sheets in a single layer. You should have made about 15 ravioli with one quarter of the pasta dough.\nRepeat with the remaining dough and filling.\nBring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add ravioli. Reduce heat to a gentle simmer; cook until ravioli float to the top and are tender which is about 3 minutes.\nDrain. Spoon butter sauce over ravioli.\nCombine gently with a rubber spatula.\nSprinkle with Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and combine again. Serve immediately.\nButter Sauce\nMelt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat with a pinch of salt. You can take it to the browned stage or simply melt the butter. \nTorn sage leaves can be added. I also like to sauté finely chopped garlic in the butter for a change.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nIf using measuring cups be sure to stir the flour and then spoon it in without packing the flour down.\n\n\n\n\nTop Tips\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepare by decluttering your work surface and ensuring you have space to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrain the ricotta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0Take a look at my \nTagliatelle Pasta\n recipe for some extra hints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to gently smooth out the air bubbles out using your fingers.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid the Spinach Ricotta Ravioli from sticking to the baking sheet or each other by lining with parchment paper and dust with semolina flour.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nUncooked ravioli can be frozen for up to two months. Arrange on parchment paper lined baking sheets in a single layer and freeze until solid. When frozen, bag into zip lock freezer bags. Cook from frozen. Frozen ravioli will take 1 or 2 minutes longer to cook. Taste to check.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, read the post above.\n\n\n\n\n \nTried this recipe?

I don’t have broadband but can access you from my phone. I made ricotta yesterday then made ricotta and spinach raviolis. First time making ricotta and it’s beautiful. Had enough left to sweeten with honey and have it on toast with choc hazelnut sprinkles – I whizzed up a bar of hazelnut choc.

Had to throw it out and found a better recipe.\n\n\n\n\nReply\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcellina\n \nsays:\n \n\n\n\n\nNovember 20, 2023 at 3:07 pm\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello Punky. I suspect that you have incorrectly measured the flour. Weighing is the best method however if you are using measuring cups be sure to stir the flour then spoon into the cups without packing the flour. My family pasta dough recipe is very similar to all other recipes for pasta dough (1 egg per 100 grams of flour). Pasta dough is incredibly forgiving and you should never have to throw it out (what a waste!). Too dry? Add a little water. Too wet? Add a little flour. Luckily pasta dough isn’t a science. Nonnas in Italy have been making it for years without measuring. However I understand that if you’ve never made pasta dough you would need a recipe. Saying that, if you had made it as specified in the recipe, you would have gradually been incorporating the flour in so you know when enough flour has been incorporated.

I top each bowl off with fresh avocado, pan-fried edamame, and a generous side of creamy mayo. Each bowl is colorful and full of flavor. A great family dinner any night of the week.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate from Texas! It’s Monday now, but by the time you read this, I’ll be on my way home. I’m excited to get back to family and my daily routines. I’ve loved all this travel, but I think we all know that I’m a homebody through and through!\xa0\n\n\nIf all goes planned, I’ll be home in plenty of time today to chill and get organized. I usually get in super late, but I should have some of the afternoon left, which will be a really nice change!\xa0\n\n\nI obviously made this yummy bowl before leaving home and it’s already become a real favorite. \n\n\n\n\nMom and Asher love a nice rice bowl dinner. So I made chicken katsu for them and it was a huge hit!\xa0\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\n\nI started with the soy sauce marinade, it’s so simple. I mixed tamari (which is what I use, it’s gluten-free soy sauce), a bit of honey, ginger, and green onions. Then I let the chicken sit in the marinade a few minutes before cooking.\xa0\n\n\nYou won’t use all of the marinade, so reserve the rest for serving with your katsu bowls.\xa0\n\n\nFor the chicken, I made sure to keep it simple and easy. I used chicken cutlets, then simply breaded them in Panko and sesame seeds. Super simple, but when put together with the rest of the ingredients and served over rice…so delicious.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nPan-fry the chicken until crispy on both sides. Then toss some frozen edamame into the skillet with a little soy sauce. The edamame ends up becoming almost “fried” and is so delicious.\n\n\nMost poke bowls have a spicy mayo on top, so I wanted to add that to these bowls too! It’s usually just mayo and sriracha mixed together, but I also added soy sauce and a small drizzle of honey to balance the sweet.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nThe only other “must-have” item here is rice. The rest are extra, but I really do recommend toppings!\n\n\nMy bowls almost always include cucumber, avocado, and pickled ginger.\xa0\n\n\nReally fun if you’re looking to switch up your chicken and rice bowls. Of course, over here, it’s all about the sauces, so those are a must. And the crispy chicken is extra delish too!\n\n\n\n\nLooking for other rice bowls favorites?\n\n\nRed’s Favorite Spicy Tuna Poke Bowls\n\n\nSkillet Chicken Adobo with Coconut Rice\n\n\n30 Minute Pineapple Chicken with Coconut Rice\n\n\nWeeknight Sesame Teriyaki Chicken with Ginger Rice\n\n\nLastly, if you make Crispy Chicken Katsu Bowls, be sure to leave a comment and/or give this recipe a rating! Above all, I love to hear from you guys and always do my best to respond to each and every comment. And of course, if you do make this recipe, don’t forget to tag me on Instagram!

This was so good! The chicken was crispy and delicious and the sauce/marinade was beautiful and solidified the flavours. I didn’t do the sauce (I just bought regular store kewpie mayo, sorry!), and just defrosted edamame beans.

I do want to know how to make the cucumbers. I didn’t have panko so I used crushed cornflakes, other breadcrumbs and sesame seeds handled with care and it stayed on while frying.\n\nSpicy mayo and remainder of soy ginger sauce added such yum.

I had issue with the panko staying on the chicken, any ideas how to better adhere it? I pounded it in like the recipe said, but it fell off into the pan and a lot of it burned.

Thanks a bunch for giving this recipe a try and your comment, love to hear that it turned out nicely for you! So sorry about the panko, I really don’t have any other tips for that than just pressing everything in really hard.

But that helped a lot. I think it also helped that I used tenderloins instead of chicken breasts because the tenderloins aren’t as smooth.\n\n\n\n\nReply\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment navigation\n\n\n\n\nOlder Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet Tieghan Gerard\nI’m Tieghan, the recipes you’ll find here are inspired by the people and places I love most.

Spanakopita is a delicious savory Greek pie made of perfectly crispy layers of phyllo dough and a comforting filling of spinach and feta cheese. I’m sharing my family’s favorite spanakopita recipe, complete with tips, video, and step-by-step photos. Trust me, this is so much easier to make than you think!\n\n\nSpanakopita makes a great side dish for large holiday dinners next to \nlamb\n or \nlemon chicken.\n But it can easily stand alone as the main dish. Serve it with a big salad like \nGreek salad;\n\xa0\nBalela\n; or this \nMediterranean chickpea salad,\n and favorite dips like \nGreek Tzatziki\n or \nRoasted Garlic Hummus.\n\n\nThis post is sponsored by \nThe Fillo Factory.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Spanakopita?\n\n\nMy little one describes spanakopita this way, “yummy, crispy cheese pie with lots of green stuff!”\n\n\nSpanakopita is a popular Greek savory pie made of perfectly flaky phyllo dough with a comforting filling of spinach and feta cheese nestled in. If you’re not familiar with phyllo dough, it is basically layered sheets of tissue-thin pastry dough, typically found in the freezer section next to things like pie crust and puff pastry.\n\n\nSpanakopita can be made in a large casserole dish like in today’s recipe, or in the form of hand pies shaped in triangles or even rolls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was at an Atlanta-area Greek festival a few weeks ago, my daughter’s lunch of choice was a piece of spanakopita and a side of \nGreek salad\n. Luckily, she allowed me a taste; it was heavenly! I ended up chatting with the woman behind the lavish lunch, her name was Yiayia Helen. We discussed family recipes and shared spanakopita lessons and tips…\n\n\nTips for How to Make Spanakopita\n\n\n1. What is in the spanakopita filling?\xa0\n\n\nThe key filling ingredients in a classic spanakopita recipe are spinach and feta cheese. And yes, only use quality feta cheese, no other cheese qualifies for spanakopita.\n\n\nTo the spinach and feta, we add flavor makers in the form of fresh herbs and aromatics. I used two whole bunches of parsley (parsley stems pack a ton of flavor, by the way, so don’t be afraid to throw some in) Then, onions, garlic and a little dry dill weed.\n\n\nTo bind everything together, I used four large eggs.\n\n\nSpanakopita filling ingredients: spinach, feta cheese, fresh parsley, dill weed, onions, garlic, eggs, olive oil, salt and pepper\n\n\n2. Do I need to cook the spinach in advance? \n\n\nYou need a good amount of spinach in this recipe, so using frozen spinach is the way to go. In this easy spanakopita recipe, frozen spinach–fully thawed, of course–is mixed right in with the remaining filling ingredients, no advanced cooking necessary.\n\n\nBut one thing you must do, be sure to drain all liquid from the thawed spinach. I ended up squeezing the spinach by hand a few times until it could no longer produce any liquid. If you do use fresh spinach, you will need to cook it with the onions and garlic, drain, and let cool completely before mixing the filling.\n\n\nMix Spanakopita filling ingredients\n\n\n3. The Phyllo\n\n\nGolden, crispy phyllo pastry, encasing the soft spinach filling is really what spanakopita is all about! Quality of phyllo (fillo) dough can make or break the recipe! I am a big fan of organic dough from \nThe Fillo Factory\n. It’s vegan and contains no preservatives; no cholesterol; and no trans fat. And be sure follow the tips below for best results.\n\n\nTips for working with Phyllo Dough:\n\n\n– Thaw phyllo dough properly; too much moisture will make the dough or sheets sticky and hard to manage. \xa0When thawing, do not remove the phyllo (fillo) from the package, place it in the fridge 12-14 hours before using.\n\n\nPlace phyllo sheets in between two clean and slightly damp paper towels. This will keep them from tearing too much as you are working to assemble spanakopita.\n\n\n-Before you begin assembling the spanakopita casserole, unroll the thawed phyllo (fillo) sheets and place them carefully between two ever-so-slightly damp kitchen cloths. This helps the sheets remain lenient so they won’t tear too much.\n\n\nBrush each layer of phyllo with extra virgin olive oil. This photo is about 1/2 way through the phyllo package.\n\n\n-Do not skimp on the oil, but don’t overdo it either. Some use butter, but I use quality extra virgin olive oil here instead to keep it light. You need to brush each of the phyllo layers with a little olive oil (see the video as well)\n\n\n\n\n-Remember, Phyllo (fillo) sheets will tear, and that’s perfectly fine. Just make sure you save a couple good sheets for the top of your spanakopita casserole.\n\n\nOnce spanakopita filling is spread well in the center, lay the remainder of the phyllo dough sheets on top (you will follow the same process, working one sheet at a time and brushing each layer with extra virgin olive oil.)\n\n\nCan I make Spanakopita Ahead of Time? What about Leftovers?\n\n\n–\xa0 You can make spanakopita the evening before you need to serve it. Follow the instructions for assembling, but do not bake. Cover tightly and refrigerate overnight. When you are ready, go ahead and bake according to recipe instructions. Budget 1 hour for baking.\n\n\n– Already cooked spanakopita will keep well if properly storied in the fridge for 2 to 3 evenings. Heat in medium-heated oven until warmed through. You can also portion cooked leftover spanakopita and freeze for a later time. Warm in oven; no need to thaw in advance.\n\n\n\n\nWatch the video for How to Make Spanakopita:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever Miss a Recipe!

Stir until all is well-combined.\n\n\nUnroll the phyllo (fillo) sheets and place them between two\n slightly\n damp kitchen cloths.\n\n\nPrepare a 9 1/2″ X 13″ baking dish like \nthis one\n. Brush the bottom and sides of the dish with olive oil.\n\n\nTo assemble the spanakopita: Line the baking dish with two sheets of phyllo (fillo) letting them cover the sides of the dish. Brush with olive oil. Add two more sheets in the same manner, and brush them with olive oil. Repeat until two-thirds of the phyllo (fillo) is used up.\n\n\nNow, evenly spread the spinach and feta filling over the phyllo (fillo) crust. Top with two more sheets, and brush with olive oil.\n\n\nContinue to layer the phyllo (fillo) sheets, two-at-a-time, brushing with olive oil, until you have used up all the sheets. Brush the very top layer with olive oil, and sprinkle with just a few drops of water.\n\n\nFold the flaps or excess from the sides, you can crumble them a little. Brush the folded sides well with olive oil.\xa0Cut Spanakopita ONLY PART-WAY through into squares, or leave the cutting to later.\n\n\nBake in the 325 degrees F heated-oven for 1 hour, or until the phyllo (fillo) crust is crisp and golden brown. Remove from the oven. Finish cutting into squares and serve. Enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips for Working with Phyllo:\n As mentioned earlier in the post, remember that phyllo is paper thin and will break as you are working with it. For best results, place phyllo dough sheets in between two very slightly damp kitchen towels (step #4) before you start working with it (unless you think you will work fast enough that the phyllo will not dry out.) Also, be sure to brush each layer with oil; don’t skimp.\n\n\nMake Ahead Tips:\n You can make spanakopita the evening before. Follow up to step #9, cover and refrigerate. When you are ready, go ahead and bake according to step #10.\n\n\nLeftover Storing and Freezing Tips:\n Already cooked spanakopita will keep well if properly storied in the fridge for 2 to 3 evenings. Heat in medium-heated oven until warmed through. You can also portion cooked leftover spanakopita and freeze for a later time. Warm in oven; no need to thaw in advance.\n\n\nWhat to Serve with Spanakopita?\n Spanakopita makes a great side dish for large holiday dinners next to \nlamb\n or \nlemon chicken.\n But it can easily stand alone as the main dish. Serve it with a big salad like \nGreek salad;\n\xa0\nBalela\n; or this \nMediterranean chickpea salad,\n and favorite dips like \nGreek Tzatziki\n or \nRoasted Garlic Hummus.\n\n\nRecommended for this Recipe:\xa0\nPrivate Reserve\n\xa0Greek extra virgin olive oil (from organically grown and processed Koroneiki olives).\n\n\nSAVE\xa0\ntry our \nGreek olive oil bundle\n and our popular \nUltimate Mediterranean Spice Bundle\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrep Time:\n \n20 mins\nCook Time:\n \n1 hour\nCategory:\n \nEntree or Side Dish\nMethod:\n \nBaked\nCuisine:\n \nGreek\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you make this recipe?\n\n\nTag @themediterraneandish on Instagram and hashtag it #themediterraneandish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*This recipe and tutorial was originally published 11/08/2016.

I had never worked with Philo pastry but followed the instructions and I’m enjoying the most delicious pie. My only wish was that I had added a squeeze of lemon to it. Next time I will use a slightly bigger pan so the pie is not so thick.

This tabbouleh (also spelled tabouli) is even better than your favorite Lebanese restaurant's.\n\n\nUpdated by \nKathryne Taylor\n on  August 30, 2024\n236\n Reviews\n502\nComments\nJump to recipe\n\n\n\n\nFinally! I’ve figured out how to make the best tabbouleh.\n It’s just as good, if not better than, my favorite local Middle Eastern restaurant’s. If you try it, I think you’ll agree.\n\n\nTabbouleh (also spelled tabouli) is a super fresh herb and bulgur salad, with parsley being the number one ingredient. It’s dotted with diced cucumber and tomato, and dressed simply with olive oil and lemon juice. It’s refreshing, light and packed with healthy ingredients.\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll often find tabbouleh as a side dish on Mediterranean menus. It’s right at home with \nhummus\n, \nbaba ganoush\n, \nfalafel\n, feta, olives… all of my favorite things.\n\n\nI’ve attempted tabbouleh at home over the years, and I’m so pleased to share what I’ve learned with you today. Ready to make some great tabbouleh?\n\n\n\n\nTabbouleh Ingredients\n\n\nBulgur\n\n\nBulgur is parboiled cracked wheat\n, so it’s a whole grain. Once prepared, it’s tender and fluffy. Bulgur is often confused with couscous, but they’re not the same (couscous is actually tiny pasta).\n\n\nAuthentic tabbouleh is made with super fine grain (#1) bulgur and it’s soaked rather than cooked, but I haven’t been able to find it at regular grocery stores. There are several other varieties of bulgurs, and you’ll probably find only one option at the store. So, cook (or soak) it according to the package directions.\n\n\nFresh Parsley\n\n\nAuthentic tabbouli uses a ton of parsley. That’s why this salad is so green! I tried both flat-leaf and curly, and for once, curly is the way to go. Even when it’s chopped very small, curly parsley offers some extra volume that makes this tabbouleh so pleasant to eat.\n\n\nFresh Mint and Green Onion\n\n\nMint is standard and adds even more fresh flavor. That said, it can be expensive if you don’t grow it at home, so you can skip it if you’d rather.\n\n\nGreen onion is my mild onion of choice. It’s perfect in tabbouleh.\n\n\nCucumber and Tomato\n\n\nFresh cucumber and tomato add more texture and color, and build on the refreshing factor. Have I said \nrefreshing\n enough yet?\n\n\nLebanese readers have informed me that cucumber is unusual in tabbouleh, which is news to me! You can skip it if you’d like, but it’s quite nice.\n\n\nOlive Oil, Lemon Juice and Garlic\n\n\nTabbouleh is dressed in a simple combination of olive oil and lemon juice. You won’t find garlic in every tabbouleh recipe, but I think that one clove makes this recipe extra delicious.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Make the Best Tabbouleh\n\n\n1) Salt your tomato and cucumber, and drain off the excess juice.\n\n\nFortunately, this doesn’t take any extra time. Tomato and cucumber release a lot of moisture when they’re exposed to salt, and will make your tabbouleh way too watery if you do not drain it off.\n\n\nSimply combine the tomato and cucumber in a bowl with some salt (you’ll find these instructions in the recipe below), and set it aside while you chop the parsley. Drain off the excess juice before you stir the salad together. Easy!\n\n\n2) Use lots of parsley and chop it finely.\n\n\nThis recipe calls for three bunches of parsley, and the easiest way to chop that much parsley is in your food processor. You can do it by hand, but it will take a while. Don’t worry about removing the thin parsley stems—they offer a lot of great flavor.\n\n\n3) Season sufficiently with lemon juice and salt.\n\n\nTabbouleh should be zingy and full of flavor, and you’ll need to use enough lemon and salt to get there.\n\n\nWatch How to Make Tabbouleh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTabbouleh Serving Suggestions\n\n\nTabbouleh is typically served chilled or at room temperature. It’s a perfect side dish or salad to offer with Mediterranean/Middle Eastern meals. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n\n\n\nDips and spreads: \nCreamy Hummus\n, \nBaba Ganoush\n, \nTzatziki\n, \nTahini Sauce\n\n\nCrispy Baked Falafel\n\n\nFattoush Salad with Mint Dressing\n\n\nMujaddara (Lentils and Rice with Caramelized Onions)\n\n\nDukkah\n with bread and olive oil\n\n\n\n\nPlease let me know how your tabbouleh turns out in the comments!\n I hope you love it.\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\nSave this recipe!\nGet this recipe sent to your inbox, plus get new recipes from C+K every week!\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.\nEmail \n*\nSave Recipe\n \n\n\nBest Tabbouleh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n \nCookie and Kate\n\n\nPrep Time:\n \n20 minutes\n\n\nCook Time:\n \n15 minutes\n\n\nTotal Time:\n \n35 minutes\n\n\nYield:\n \n6\n servings \n1\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\t\t\t5 Stars\t\t\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\t\t\t4 Stars\t\t\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\t\t\t3 Stars\t\t\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\t\t\t2 Stars\t\t\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\t\t\t1 Star\t\t\t\n \n \n \n4.8\n from \n236\n reviews\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n \n\n\nSaved\nSave\nSave to Favorites\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to make delicious, authentic tabbouleh at home! This tabbouleh (also spelled tabouli) is even better than your favorite Lebanese restaurant’s. Recipe yields 6 servings (a little over 1 cup each).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngredients\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScale\n\n\n1x\n2x\n3x\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n½ cup\n bulgur\n\n\n1 cup\n diced cucumber (\n1\n small-to-medium)\n\n\n1 cup\n diced tomato* (\n1\n large)\n\n\n1 teaspoon\n fine salt, divided\n\n\n3\n medium bunches curly parsley\n\n\n⅓ cup\n (\n⅔ ounce\n) chopped fresh mint (optional but recommended—you can chop it in the food processor with the parsley)\n\n\n⅓ cup\n thinly sliced green onion\n\n\n⅓ cup\n extra-virgin olive oil\n\n\n3\n to \n4\n tablespoons lemon juice, to taste\n\n\n1\n medium clove garlic, pressed or minced\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCook or soak the bulgur until tender according to package directions. Drain off any excess water, and set aside to cool.\n\n\nMeanwhile, combine the diced cucumber and tomato in a medium bowl with ½ teaspoon of the salt. Stir, and let the mixture rest for at least 10 minutes or until you’re ready to mix the salad.\n\n\nTo prepare the parsley, cut off the thick stems. Then, finely chop the parsley and remaining stems—you can do this by hand, but it’s much easier in a food processor with the standard “S” blade. Process 1 bunch at a time (each should yield about 1 cup chopped), transferring the chopped parsley to a large serving bowl before proceeding with the next.\n\n\nAdd the cooled bulgur, chopped fresh mint (if using) and green onion to the bowl of parsley. Strain off and discard the cucumber and tomato juice that has accumulated in the bottom of the bowl (this ensures that your tabbouleh isn’t too watery). Add the strained cucumber and tomato to the bowl.\n\n\nIn a small measuring cup or bowl, whisk together the olive oil, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, garlic, and remaining ½ teaspoon salt. Pour it into the salad and stir to combine. Taste, and adjust if necessary—add another tablespoon of lemon juice for zing, or salt for more overall flavor.\n\n\nIf you have the time, let the salad rest for 15 minutes before serving to let the flavors mingle. Otherwise, you can serve it immediately or chill it for later. Tabbouleh will keep well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 4 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nMake it gluten free:\n Bulgur is not gluten free (it’s cracked wheat). Substitute quinoa for an untraditional gluten-free option. You’ll use the same amount (½ cup) uncooked quinoa, or 1 ½ cups cooked leftover quinoa. \nHere’s how to cook quinoa\n.\n\n\n*Tomato note:\n Use the most ripe and red tomatoes you can find! If you’re making this salad when tomatoes aren’t in season, cherry tomatoes might be your best bet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNutrition \nShow Nutrition\nHide Nutrition\n\n\n\n\nThe information shown is an estimate provided by an online nutrition calculator.

Serve this vegan Turkish dish by itself with Tzatziki on the side or as a side dish with your meat dishes.\n\n\nReady in about 30 minutes, this recipe is a good one to start if you are new to cooking bulgur wheat in your daily cooking.\n\n\nYields\n4\n \nservings (4 cups of cooked bulgur)\nPrep Time\n10\n minutes\n \nmins\nCook Time\n18\n minutes\n \nmins\nTotal Time\n28\n minutes\n \nmins\n\n\nYou can not talk about \nTurkish cuisine\n and not mention \nBulgur Pilaf\n. If you have ever been there (or any other Middle Eastern or Mediterranean Country), you know this easy vegan side dish is a staple that we serve with almost all our \nmeat dishes\n.\n\n\nIn this post I will show you how to make Bulgur pilaf (as we call \nBulgur Pilavi\n) in two different ways. First, the classic \nTomato Bulgur Pilaf\n and then second the version of it made with \nBulgur Pilaf with Vermicelli\n.\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWhat Is Bulgur Pilaf?\nIngredients:\nHow To Prepare Bulgur for Making Pilaf?

Can I cook this pilaf with other types of bulgur wheat?\nHelpful Tips from My Mom’s Recipe Book:\nHow To Freeze?\nWhat To Serve It With?\nOther Recipes with Bulgur Wheat:\nTurkish Bulgur Pilaf Recipe\nOther Turkish recipes you might like:\n\n\nBefore I continue talking about this Turkish bulgur dish, I recommend that you check out my post on \nWhat is Bulgur Wheat\n where I covered everything you need to know about different types of bulgur, where to purchase it, and how it is different from crack wheat.\n\n\nAnd if you’d rather cook bulgur in a more basic way, feel free to check out the post I wrote on \nHow To Prepare and Cook Bulgur like rice\n to learn how different types of bulgur are cooked differently (and why) along with other bulgur recipes to help you incorporate it in your daily cooking.\n\n\nWhat Is Bulgur Pilaf?\n\n\nBulgur pilaf is a Turkish vegetarian (or vegan) side dish made by cooking bulgur with various vegetables, and water (or stock) on the stove top. With that being said, it is a staple in many other Middle Eastern countries including Lebanon and Syria.\n\n\nIn some circles, what we call bulgur pilaf is referred to as Turkish bulgur rice pilaf recipe as the method of cooking is very similar to cooking rice.\n\n\nIngredients:\n\n\n\n\nTo make this Turkish Bulgur Pilaf recipe, you will need:\n\n\n\n\nCoarse Bulgur Wheat #3:\n While I used coarse bulgur wheat to make this recipe, both medium coarse #2 and extra coarse #4 would work in the recipe.\n\n\nTomato & Tomato Paste:\n One medium size tomato cut into small cubes should be fine. You can also use a cup of canned diced tomatoes.\n\n\nOnion:\n Chopped\n\n\nGreen pepper:\n Seeded jalapeno or green (or any other color) bell peppers would both work.\n\n\nChickpeas:\n I used a can of chickpeas to add in a bit more plant-protein into the recipe.\n\n\nCooking Liquid:\n You can use both water or vegetable stock.\n\n\nSpices:\n I used ground cumin with salt and pepper\n\n\n\n\nHow To Prepare Bulgur for Making Pilaf? Should I rinse it before cooking?\n\n\nWhile there is nothing special that you need to do to prepare it for cooking, most people wonder \nwhether or not to rinse bulgur wheat before cooking\n.\xa0\n\n\nYou cannot go wrong either way\n. It is a personal preference.\n\n\nGrowing up my mother always rinsed bulgur before cooking. Nowadays, if I am buying packaged bulgur I usually skip rinsing it.\xa0\n\n\nThe only time I rinse bulgur before cooking is if I am buying it from the bulk bin section of our grocery store as they might get dusty easily.\n\n\nHow To Rinse Bulgur Wheat?\n\n\nIf you decide to rinse it, simply place it in a fine mesh strainer, rinse under cold running water for 30-45 seconds, and drain it before adding into the pot.\n\n\nHow To Cook It in Turkish Style?\n\n\nThis Mediterranean Bulgur Wheat Pilaf recipe is truly easy and quick to make. Here is how you cook it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaute onion and tomato paste:\n Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add in onion, green pepper, and saute until translucent, 3-4 minutes. Add in tomato paste and stir constantly for a minute or so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd in the rest of the ingredients: \nAdd in ground cumin, bulgur, tomatoes, chickpeas, and water (or stock).\xa0Season with salt and pepper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStir & Bring it to a boil: \nGive it a stir, bring it to a boil, put the lid on, turn down the heat to low. Let it simmer for 10-12 minutes or until most of the liquid is absorbed.\n\n\nLet it rest & serve: \nOff the heat, allow it to rest for 10 minutes (with the lid on), fluff it with a fork. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley and serve.\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t find coarse bulgur in your local supermarket, you can buy it on Amazon. This \nTurkish brand coarse bulgur \n (affiliate link) is the one I use and recommend.\n\n\n\n\nBulgur With Vermicelli – Mom’s Version\n\n\nBulgur pilaf with vermicelli was one of my mom’s signature dishes. While the bulgur pilaf made with tomato sauce is more of a traditional way of serving it, you can also make a more basic version with vermicelli.\xa0\n\n\nTo cook Bulgur Pilaf with Vermicelli:\n\n\n\n\nHeat oil (or butter): \nYou can use any oil but as it is usually the case, butter makes this pilaf taste better. Heat it in medium heat.\n\n\nSaute vermicelli: \nAdd in the vermicelli and saute until it is golden brown. It should feel like it is almost burning.\xa0\n\n\nAdd in the coarse bulgur wheat: \nAdd in bulgur and saute for 4-5 minutes while constantly stirring.\n\n\nAdd in the liquid & bring it to a boil: \nAdd in your cooking liquid (water, stock or a combination), salt and pepper and any vegetables (like I used in the recipe above) if you like. Give it a stir. Bring it to a boil, put the lid on, turn down the heat, and let it simmer for 12-15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t have vermicelli on hand? \nYou can use orzo instead. No need to make any changes to the recipe or the way that it is cooked.\n\n\nWhat Kind of Bulgur Wheat is Best? Can I cook this pilaf with other types of bulgur wheat?\n\n\nGrowing up, my mom always used coarse bulgur wheat (#3 or #4 & also known as \npilavlik bulgur\n) to make this bulgur pilaf recipe. However, you can certainly make this dish using other types of bulgur, like fine bulgur (#1), red bulgur, or medium-coarse bulgur (#2).\n\n\nThe only difference would be the cooking time as listed below:\n\n\n\n\nFine bulgur\n – shorten cooking time by 3-4 minutes\n\n\nMedium coarse bulgur\n – shorten cooking time by 2-3 minutes\n\n\nRed Bulgur\n – treat it like it is medium-coarse bulgur and shorten cooking time by 2-3 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you feel confused about all these different kinds of bulgur? \nIf you are new to cooking bulgur and adding it in your recipes, but don’t know which one to get, feel free to check out my post I wrote on \nTypes of Bulgur Wheat\n. \n\n\nI made sure to explain everything you need to know about shopping for and cooking with bulgur wheat to help you feel confident about bulgur wheat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpful Tips from My Mom’s Recipe Book:\n\n\nMy mom used to refer to these tips as “\nthe secret to making the best bulgur pilaf recipe\n.”\xa0\n\n\n\n\nUse butter:\n Even though you can certainly make bulgur pilaf with only vegetable oil, my mom thought that using butter was the key to a good-tasting pilaf. She used 2 tablespoons of butter per 1-cup of bulgur.\nWith that being said, if you want to make a \nvegan version of this bulgur pilaf recipe\n, you can omit the butter and use only vegetable oil instead.\n\n\nUse boiling water and/or homemade stock:\n Instead of using cold (or room temperature) water, she would use boiling water to make the cooking process faster. Also, if we had it available, she would substitute 1 cup of the 2 cups of liquid with chicken or vegetable stock.\n\n\nLet it rest:\n This was another big step. Once all the liquid was absorbed, she would remove the lid, cover it with a paper towel, and put the lid back on to rest for at least 5-10 minutes before serving. Then she would fluff it with a fork, taste it for seasoning, and add more if necessary.\n\n\n\n\nHow To Freeze?\n\n\nTo freeze this bulgur pilaf recipe simply bring it to room temperature, place it in an airtight container, and freeze up to 2 months.\n\n\nThaw it a day in advance in the fridge and warm it up on the stove before you are ready to serve it.\n\n\nWhat To Serve It With?\n\n\nTraditionally, we serve this bulgur pilaf recipe as a side dish with \nchicken\n and \nmeat dishes\n. However, below I do have some serving suggestions for those of you who are following a vegetarian diet as well.\n\n\nAs A Side Dish with Meat Dishes:\n\n\n\n\nBeef Stew\n\n\nInstant Pot Pot Roast\n\n\nIna Garten’s Pot Roast\n\n\nTurkish Meatball recipe\n\n\nOrange Chicken with Fennel\n\n\nMeatball Potato Casserole\n\n\n\n\nAs A Vegetarian Dish With:\n\n\n\n\nTzatziki Sauce\n – A bowl of it on the side would be perfect\n\n\nYogurt Dressing\n – A drizzle of my yogurt salad dressing on top would be great\n\n\nCauliflower Curry\n – I use this simple bulgur pilaf recipe as a bedding for my favorite vegan recipe like this cauliflower curry recipe.\n\n\n\n\nOther Recipes with Bulgur Wheat:\n\n\n\n\nTabbouleh Salad\n\n\nChicken with Bulgur\n\n\nMiddle Eastern Stuffed Peppers\n\n\nBulgur Wheat Butternut Squash Salad\n\n\nVegan Chili\n – This recipe uses coarse bulgur to mimic the meat texture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave\nSaved\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurkish Bulgur Pilaf Recipe\n\n\n5\n from \n15\n votes\n\n\nBy: \nAysegul Sanford\n\n\n\n\nYields\n4\n \nservings (4 cups of cooked bulgur)\n\n\nPrep Time\n10\n minutes\n \nmins\nCook Time\n18\n minutes\n \nmins\nResting Time\n10\n minutes\n \nmins\n\n\nTotal Time\n28\n minutes\n \nmins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to make the best Turkish bulgur pilaf recipe with tomatoes and vegetables. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngredients\xa0\n1x\n2x\n3x\n▢ \n2\n \ntbsp\n \noil\n, \nor butter\n▢ \n1\n \nonion\n, \nchopped, medium sized (approximately 1 cup)\n▢ \n1\n \ngreen pepper\n, \nseeded jalapeno or a small bell pepper would work (approximately 1/2 cup)\n▢ \n2\n \ntbsp\n \ntomato paste\n▢ \n1 \n \nteaspoon \n \nground cumin\n▢ \n1\n \ncup\n \ncoarse bulgur\n, \nboth coarse and extra coarse bulgur would work for this recipe\n▢ \n1\n \nfresh tomato\n, \ncut into small cubes (approximately 1 cup)\n▢ \n1 \n \ncan \n \nchickpeas\n, \ndrained and rinsed \n▢ \n2\n \ncups\n \nwater\n, \nboiling water (or you can use vegetable stock)\n▢ \n1\n \nteaspoon\n \nsalt\n▢ \n1/4\n \nteaspoon\n \nground black pepper\nGarnishes\n▢ \nhandful of Italian\n, \nor flat leaf parsley, chopped\n\n\nInstructions\xa0\nSaute onion and tomato paste:\n Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

With a rich tomato and bean sauce with added veggies, it’s a hearty, delicious and satisfying midweek dinner. \n\n\n\n\nHello autumn! And welcome back bonfires and woolly sweaters and casseroles my old friends. \n\n\nYou know I love a \nslow cooker recipe\n, but we can get stuck in a rut with the kinds of meat we’re using \n(if you’re indeed a meat-eater)\n. \n\n\nSO I needed to try and make a \nsausage casserole in the slow cooker\n!\n\n\nMainly because sausages are such a big hit with the whole family, are versatile, inexpensive and ideal for keeping in the freezer.\n\n\nThis \nSlow Cooker Sausage Casserole \nis SO GOOD on all counts.\n\n\nWholesome beans and a thick, rich tomato sauce. Totally satisfying, hearty and delicious. I hope you love it as much as we do!\n\n\n\n\nWhy you’ll love this Slow Cooker Sausage Casserole recipe\n\n\n⭐️ Packed with \nrich flavour\n\n\n⭐️ Includes lots of\n hidden veg\n\n\n⭐️ \nSuper easy\n and hardly any prep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow we came up with this recipe\n\n\nA version of a Slow Cooker Sausage Casserole has been here on the site since 2021.\n\n\nThe\n original version \nincluded fried chorizo, which I love, but this year I really wanted to update the recipe slightly to make it more affordable. \n(Of course, you could still add chorizo pieces if you wanted.)\n\n\nSo, this recipe uses\n sausages and vegetables\n, along with cannellini beans for added nutrients, making a complete meal.\n\n\nIf you’d like a non-slow cooker version, you could try my tasty \nSausage Casserole with Cider and Bacon\n, which cooks in the oven instead. \n\n\n\n\nWhat to serve with Sausage & Bean Casserole\n\n\n\n\nBaked potatoes\n\n\nRice\n\n\nPotato wedges\n\n\nCous cous – Love this as it’s super speedy.\n\n\nAdd sliced chillis or chilli sauce\n\n\nMashed potatoes\n\n\nHomemade chips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlow Cooker Sausage Casserole Ingredients\n\n\n\n\nSunflower oil\n\n\nSausages \n– Leave them whole or chop up if you like\n\n\nRed onion \n– I sometimes use pre-chopped frozen onions for speed, but you can use fresh too\n\n\nGarlic\n – Same as above\n\n\nTinned chopped tomatoes\n\n\nCannellini beans\n – Tinned\n\n\nTomato puree\n\n\nCumin\n\n\nSweet smoked paprika\n – Be careful not to use HOT smoked paprika. The outcome will be very different!\xa0\n\n\nBeef stock cube\n\n\nCarrots \n\n\nSea salt \nand\n freshly ground black pepper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to make Slow Cooker Sausage Casserole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Pan fry the sausages until browned. \n(If your slow cooker pan is the type that can be used on the hob too, you can do this in the pan.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Add all of the other ingredients into the slow cooker, give it a good stir and put on the lid. Cook as per the recipe below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeftovers\n\n\nIn the fridge\n You can keep this recipe in the fridge for 3 days. Reheat fully before serving.\n\n\nIn the freezer\n This recipe freezes well. Just wait until it’s totally cold and then put into a freezer proof container and freeze for up to 3 months. Defrost thoroughly before reheating.\n\n\n\n\nTop tips\n\n\nSausages\n\n\nI like to use sausages with a high meat content (97% if you can get it) without too many other flavourings as there’s already a lot in the sauce. If you use smaller sausages like chipolata sausages, just reduce the cooking time slightly.\xa0\n\n\nMore sausage recipes\n\n\nSeeing as they’re always popular and great value for money, why not also try out my foolproof \nToad in the Hole recipe\n, my \nCreamy Sausage Pasta\n or \nSausage Orzo\n one-pots, my \nSticky Sausage Tray Bake\n or my \nCowboy Pie\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\nCan I cook this in the oven instead? \n \nSure. Cook at 160C for about an 1 hour or until the sausages is soft and tender.\n \n \nWhich slow cooker do you use? \n \nI love \nthis one (available to buy on Amazon\n) as it has a pan that you can use on the hob to brown your meats first and then transfer straight into the cooker.

(If your slow cooker pan is the type that can be used on the hob too, you can do this in the pan.)\nAdd all of the other ingredients into the slow cooker, give it a good stir and put on the lid.\nCook on HIGH for 6 hours or LOW for 8 hours.\nStir everything well and serve. (I like to cut up the sausages using scissors before serving.)\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nOnions and garlic:\xa0\nI use pre prepared frozen, chopped here. An onion weighs about 150g, so replace with that pre chopped weight. Garlic is about 5g per clove so I use 15g (3 teaspoons).\n\n\nSweet smoked paprika:\xa0\nBe sure to use SWEET Smoked, not HOT. The outcome will be very different if you mix them up!\n\n\nIf you want to add chorizo: \nSimply add about 100g to the pan at the same time as you’re frying off your sausages.\n\n\nNutrition\nCalories: \n363\nkcal\nProtein: \n17\ng\nFat: \n32\ng\nSaturated Fat: \n10\ng\nPolyunsaturated Fat: \n4\ng\nMonounsaturated Fat: \n15\ng\nTrans Fat: \n0.2\ng\nCholesterol: \n82\nmg\nSodium: \n722\nmg\nPotassium: \n281\nmg\nVitamin A: \n85\nIU\nVitamin C: \n1\nmg\nCalcium: \n10\nmg\nIron: \n1\nmg\nNutrition information is automatically calculated, so should only be used as an approximation.\n\n\nAdditional Info\nCourse: \nMain Course\nCuisine: \nFamily Food\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLike this?

Please read my \ndisclosure policy\n.\n\n\nOyakodon is a classic comfort food of Japanese home cooking. Tender pieces of chicken, onions, and eggs are simmered in an umami-rich sauce and then poured over a bowl of fluffy steamed rice. Simple, delicious, and utterly comforting, this is the kind of one-bowl meal you can cook in less than 30 minutes!\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to mainstream fast food, Japan offers not only hamburgers and french fries, but the menu also extends to noodles and donburi (rice bowl) meals.\n\n\nDuring lunchtime, you’d see diners and noodle shops around the office buildings crowded with Japanese office workers making their fuss-free fast food orders. These lunch spots usually serve up quick one-bowl meals, and \nOyakodon\n (親子丼) or \nOyako Donburi\n (親子丼ぶり) is often one of the popular choices.\n\n\nToday, let’s make this quick and easy \nChicken and Egg Rice Bowl\n at home! \n\n\nTable of Contents\nWhat is Oyakodon?\nWhy You’ll Love This Recipe\nIngredients for Oyakodon\nHow to Make the Best Oyakodon\nHow to Make Dashi (Japanese Soup Stock)\nCooking Tips\nWhy Cooking in an Oyakodon Pan?\nWhat is the Best Rice Cooker?\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Oyakodon?\n\n\nAn epitome of Japanese soul food, \noyakodon\n (親子丼) literally translates to parent-and-child (oya-ko) rice bowl (don) as the dish is composed of chicken and egg. \n\n\nBite-size chicken, tender onion, and softly cooked egg are layered and simmered together in a sweet-salty\xa0sauce made with dashi, soy sauce, and mirin and served on a bed of steamed rice. The contrast of  textures and flavors makes you craving for more bites.\n\n\nLike \nGyudon\n and \nKatsudon\n, oyakodon is not only a long-time restaurant favorite but also a staple dish of Japanese households. Just as the name implies, everything about the rice bowl brings comfort and warmth.\n\n\n\n\nWhy You’ll Love This Recipe\n\n\n\n\nOne pan and one bowl meal.\n It is an ideal solution when thinking of easy weeknight meals. Fewer dishes = easy cleanup!\n\n\nQuick and easy 30-minute cooking!\n This dish can be whipped up with minimal time and effort. I first learned how to cook oyakodon in my home and economics class in middle school. These days, it is still one of my go-to comfort foods. If you have teenagers at home, oyakodon is a great dish they could easily master. It is a survival meal that will sustain them when they go to college.\n\n\nEasy-to-access, pantry-friendly ingredients.\n Chicken, egg, and onion are standard ingredients in most cuisines. I usually have them handy in my refrigerator (or freezer for chicken). As for the condiments, if you cook Japanese or Asian food often, you most likely have condiments and a dashi packet or powder.\n\n\nNo oil!\n The onions and chicken are simmered in a broth. There’s no frying with oil.\n\n\nA satisfying comfort meal at home.\n Tender chicken and a soft-cooked egg are served over a bed of rice. The rice absorbs delicious dashi sauce, and every mouthful is sweet, salty, and savory. Here you have it: a belly-filling, delicious comfort meal in one bowl.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngredients for Oyakodon\n\n\n\n\nChicken thighs\n — I recommend thighs over breasts because fattier thighs are more flavorful, tender, and forgiving (compared to dry, overcooked breasts).\n\n\nSake\n — Drizzling a tablespoon of sake over chicken helps remove its gamey odor.\n\n\nOnion\n\n\nEggs\n\n\nSeasonings\n — \nDashi (Japanese soup stock)\n, soy sauce, mirin, and sugar.\n\n\nSteamed Rice\n\n\nGarnish\n — Thinly sliced green onion or \nmitsuba\n (Used in many donburi dishes, this Japanese wild parsley has a celery-like flavor with a slightly bitter but refreshing taste.)\n\n\nOptional seasonings at the table\n — \nShichimi togarashi\n (Japanese seven spice for a spicy kick) and \nsansho pepper powder\n (It is finely ground peppercorns from the prickly ash tree. It has a vibrant, peppery lemon flavor with a long residual heat).\n\n\n\n\nHow to Make the Best Oyakodon\n\n\n\n\nPrepare the ingredients: Cut the onion, mitsuba/green onions, and chicken and crack the eggs.\n\n\nCook the onion in the seasoning mixture.\n\n\nAdd the chicken and cook until no longer pink.\n\n\nDrizzle egg mixture at two separate times. Garnish mitsuba/green onions.\n\n\nSpoon the finished dish over the bed of steamed rice in a donburi bowl.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Make Dashi (Japanese Soup Stock)\n\n\n\n\nHomemade Dashi\n\n\nDashi Packet\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes this chicken and egg rice bowl authentically Japanese? It’s the flavor of \ndashi (Japanese soup stock)\n. If you’re not familiar with dashi, think of this ingredient as the most essential flavor of Japanese cuisine. The good news is:\n\n\n\n\nIt’s so easy to make compared to other stocks; \nhomemade dashi\n takes 30 minutes.\n\n\nIt can be vegan-friendly – read \nVegan Dashi\n.\n\n\nDashi can be made instantly with a \ndashi packet\n (my preferred method over dashi powder).\n\n\n\n\nI highly recommend reading my \nUltimate Dashi Guide\n as dashi appears in the majority of Japanese recipes and you can’t avoid it.\n\n\nFor two servings, I recommend making a pot of dashi (about 4 cups) and then using ½ cup for Oyakodon and the leftover (3½ cups) for \nHomemade Miso Soup\n to serve as a meal set. Now you have a filling rice bowl and a soothing miso soup. \n\n\nCooking Tips\n\n\nTip 1: Use the Japanese cutting technique \n“Sogigiri”\n\n\nThis\xa0\n“\nsogigiri\n” cutting technique\n\xa0gives each piece of the ingredient equal thickness and creates more surface area for faster cooking and better absorption of the flavors.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, after trying out different sizes of chicken pieces, I realized that cutting the chicken into \n2-cm (3/4 inch)\n pieces worked the best. Big pieces of chicken tend to separate from the rest of the ingredients while smaller pieces are better at incorporating with the onions and soft-cooked eggs. \n\n\nTip 2: “Cut” the egg whites\n\n\nFor the best-looking oyakodon, aim for high color contrast between the white and yellow parts of the eggs. That’s why it’s important not to beat the eggs. If you use a beaten egg mixture, you will get one uniform yellow color on your oyakodon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, “cut” the egg whites 5-6 times with a pair of chopsticks, lifting the whites to break them up into a few smaller clumps. This will prevent the egg whites from falling into the frying pan all at once. \n\n\nHow about the egg yolks? While cutting the egg whites, you may have accidentally broken some of the egg yolks. That’s perfect! \n\n\nYou don’t want to blend the yolks and whites together. If the yolks haven’t broken yet, you can gently break them a little bit. The egg whites and yolks are broken, but still\xa0distinct, and they should look like a marble pattern.\n\n\nThe standard number of eggs for oyakodon is \n2 eggs per serving\n. The eggs bind all the other ingredients in the simmering sauce together so that the finished oyakodon can slide onto the bed of steamed rice smoothly. \n\n\nIf you’re cooking for two servings in a medium frying pan, you can use 3 eggs, \n1½ eggs per serving\n. However, I don’t recommend using fewer eggs than that as they won’t be able to bind all the ingredients together.\n\n\nTip 3: Cook 2 servings at a time\n\n\nLet’s say you want to multiply the recipe for your family of four or six. The ingredients and seasonings will increase significantly compared to two servings, but I assume your cooking surface will not double or triple in size. \n\n\nWhen you try to cook 4 to 6 servings in a medium frying pan (11-inch or 28 cm), the seasonings will not evaporate as efficiently as with 2 servings, and your oyakodon will end up with a lot of sauce, almost like a soup. On top of that, you will overcrowd the pan with ingredients, which will take a long time to cook. \n\n\n\n\nTherefore, I recommend using 2 frying pans, \nmaking 2 servings in each frying pan\n. You could also use a \n3.5 QT braiser\n (16 inches or 40 cm) to make 4 servings of oyakodon at once.\n\n\nTip 4: Cook oyakodon uncovered (no lid required!)\n\n\nI’ve made oyakodon both with and without a lid, testing out the cooking time, flavor, and texture and adjusting the seasoning mixture to achieve the best result.\n\n\n\n\nWith a lid on, the chicken will cook slightly faster, but the inside of the pan gets quite hot and the chicken can get overcooked while you want to simmer a bit longer for the chicken to absorb more flavors.\n\n\nAfter multiple tests, my final verdict is to cook uncovered. When you cook uncovered, the excess moisture from the onion and chicken will evaporate, which yields a more flavorful and intense sauce.\n\n\nOne exception is for cooking the eggs. If you prefer to fully cook the eggs, you may want to use a lid.\n\n\nTip 6: Add the eggs at two separate times\n\n\n\n\nTo achieve an ideal egg texture for delicious oyakodon, aim for egg whites that are somewhat firm but still wobbly and egg yolks that remain soft and runny. Since raw eggs are safe to consume in Japan, oyakodon can look a bit different when it’s served in Japan. Don’t be shocked if the eggs are a lot more on the runny and raw side there.\n\n\nIf you live outside of Japan, it’s best to cook the eggs slightly longer than how it’s cooked in Japan. It may not look as pretty, but it’s for food safety reasons.\n\n\nTo achieve the fluffy soft-cooked egg for oyakodon, we add the eggs to the simmering chicken and egg mixture at \ntwo separate times\n: \n\n\n\n\nAdd \ntwo-thirds of the eggs \n(ideally \nmore egg whites\n because they take longer time to cook than egg yolks) to the \ncenter\n of the pan, avoiding the edges where eggs get overcooked.\n\n\nAdd the remaining\n one-third of the eggs\n (ideally more egg yolks) to the entire surface of the pan. \n\n\n\n\nOne last tip! It’s faster to cook egg whites when the eggs are already at room temperature. \n\n\nWhy Cooking in an Oyakodon Pan?\n\n\nIn Japan, oyakodon is typically made in this single-serving \noyakodon pan\n. As you see in the picture below, this special pan helps slide the well-layered dish, including the sauce and soft-cooked egg, into the donburi bowl over a bed of steamed rice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only is it easy to serve, but the presentation looks better with a cleaner look. See the picture below.\n\n\n\n\nOyakodon made in an oyakodon pan.\n\n\nOyakodon made in a medium frying pan.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you cook oyakodon in a medium frying pan, you will end up breaking up the nicely layered dish despite your best attempt. A large flat spoon helps transfer a bigger portion to the bowl, but it will still not be big enough to cover the steamed rice. So restaurants and some home cooks use the single-serving oyakodon pan just to achieve the proper look of the dish.\n\n\nBesides an oyakodon pan, you can also use a small shallow frying pan that is slope-sided, so you can easily transfer the chicken and egg mixture to the bed of rice in a donburi bowl. Ideally, the diameter of the pan should be the same or smaller size pan as your bowl.\n\n\nWhere to buy an oyakodon pan?\n You can find one in the following online stores:\n\n\n\n\nAmazon\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the Best Rice Cooker?\n\n\nTo make the perfect rice for gyudon, I like to use my\xa0\nZojirushi NP-NWC10XB Rice Cooker\n. It makes fluffy rice every time and is the\xa0\nbest Japanese rice cooker\n\xa0I’ve ever used! You can get it on\xa0\nAmazon for about $445\n, and it’s well worth it if you cook a lot of rice.\n\n\nMore Easy Rice Bowl Recipes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGyudon (Quick Beef Bowl)\n\n\nTanin Don (Beef and Egg Rice Bowl)\n\n\nChicken Katsudon\n\n\nPork Curry Bowl\n\n\n12 Donburi Recipes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOyakodon (Chicken and Egg Rice Bowl)\n\n\n4.71\n from \n630\n votes\n\n\nOyakodon\n is a classic comfort food of Japanese home cooking.

See how to cook short-grain rice with a\xa0\nrice cooker\n,\xa0\npot over the stove\n,\xa0\nInstant Pot\n, or\xa0\ndonabe\n.\n \nThis recipe includes both cooking methods—using a medium frying pan (about 10 inches/25 cm) and an oyakodon pan or small frying pan (8 inches/20 cm)\n. Typically, oyakodon is made individually for each serving using an oyakodon pan, which lets you slide the cooked ingredients onto the rice bowl easily. See the separate cooking instructions below.\n \nGather all the ingredients. \nDo not make more than two servings in a medium frying pan\n. I explained a bit more in the blog post (under Oyakodon Cooking Tips). If you are making four servings, use two medium frying pans. \n \nTo Prepare the Seasonings\nCombine \n½ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock)\n, \n2 Tbsp soy sauce\n, \n2 Tbsp mirin\n, and \n2 tsp sugar\n in a bowl or a liquid measuring cup and mix all together until the sugar is dissolved. \n \nTo Prepare the Ingredients\nSlice \n½ onion\n lengthwise, about ¼ inch (6 mm) wide.\n \nChop \n4 sprigs mitsuba (Japanese parsley)\n ½ inch (1.3 cm) wide.\n \nTrim\xa0the extra bits of\xa0fat\xa0and connective\xa0tissue from \n10 oz boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n with the knife.\n \nCut the chicken thigh along the grain into strips ¾–1 inch (2–2.5 cm) wide. Next, angle your knife back and diagonally (nearly parallel to the cutting board), and then slice the chicken strips against the grain into pieces about ¾–1 inch (2–2.5 cm) square. This \nsogigiri\n cutting technique gives the chicken pieces equal thickness and creates more surface area for fast cooking and better absorption of the flavors.\n \nTransfer the chicken to a bowl or tray and sprinkle with \n1 Tbsp sake\n. Set aside for 5 minutes.\n \nCrack \n3-4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell)\n into a bowl. Using a pair of chopsticks, lift the egg whites to “cut“ them 5–6 times into a few smaller clumps. This will prevent the egg whites from falling into the frying pan all at once. Do not whisk or beat the eggs together. \nTip:\n Aim for high color contrast between the white and yellow parts of the eggs in your finished dish. \n \nWhile “cutting“ the egg whites, you may have accidentally broken some of the egg yolks. That‘s okay. If the yolks haven‘t broken yet, you can poke them to gently break them, but do not blend the egg whites and yolks. The eggs should resemble a marble pattern.\n \nTo Cook the Oyakodon in a Medium Frying Pan\nWith the stove off, add the sliced onions to a medium frying pan (I use a well-seasoned \n11” carbon steel pan\n) in a single layer. Then, add the seasonings mixture. It should just cover the onions. If not, your frying pan is too big and you need to either increase the seasoning or use a smaller pan.\n \nTurn on the heat to medium and bring it to a simmer. Once simmering, add the chicken on top of the onions. \n \nMake sure the onions and chicken are evenly distributed. Once simmering again, lower the heat to medium low. Cook, uncovered, for \n5 minutes\n or until the chicken is no longer pink and the onions are tender. Halfway through, flip the chicken. \nTip: \nEvaporation reduces the sauce and intensifies the flavor.  \n \nWe will add the eggs in \ntwo stages:\n Two-thirds of the eggs first, then the remaining one-third later. Now, increase the heat to medium. With the cooking liquid simmering (small bubbles around the edges), drizzle two-thirds of the eggs in a circular pattern over the chicken and onions, \navoiding the edges\n of the pan where the eggs can easily overcook. \nTip:\n Only drizzle the eggs if the cooking liquid is simmering, as with \nEgg Drop Soup\n. Also, try to add \nmore egg whites\n at this stage, as the whites take longer to cook than the yolks. Ideally, we want to keep the yolks soft and runny for the final presentation.\n \nIf the heat is too strong, lower the heat. If the egg is moving toward the edges of the pan, gently gather it toward the center where the heat is not as strong. Optionally, you can cover the pan if the egg whites are taking a long time to set. \n \nWhen the eggs are still runny but just set, add the rest of the eggs to the center and around the edges of the pan. Add the \nmitsuba\n (or green onion) on top and cook on medium low until the egg is done to your liking. Usually, oyakodon in Japan is served while the egg is almost set but still runny (raw eggs are safe to consume in Japan). \nTip:\n For the remaining one-third of the egg, try to distribute \nmore egg yolks\n so the oyakodon will have a bright yellow color on top. For a good presentation, you can add a beaten extra yolk at the end.\n \nServe steamed rice in individual serving bowls. Spoon the cooked chicken and egg mixture onto the steamed rice and drizzle the desired amount of pan sauce on top. \n \nTo Cook the Oyakodon in an Oyakodon Pan or a Small Frying Pan\nCook the chicken and egg in two batches, one serving at a time. Make sure to divide the ingredients in half\n. With the stove off, add half of the sliced onions to the pan in a single layer. Add half of the seasonings mixture (it should just cover the onions).\n \nTurn on the heat to medium and bring it to a simmer. Once simmering, add half of the chicken on top of the onions. \n \nMake sure the onions and chicken are evenly distributed. Once simmering, lower the heat to medium low. Cook, uncovered, for \n4 minutes\n or until the chicken is no longer pink and the onions are tender. Halfway through, flip the chicken. \nTip: \nEvaporation helps to reduce the sauce and intensify the flavor. \n \nWe will add the eggs in \ntwo stages:\n Two-thirds of the eggs first, then the remaining one-third later. Now, increase the heat to medium. With the cooking liquid simmering (small bubbles around the edges), drizzle two-thirds of the eggs in a circular pattern over the chicken and onions, \navoiding the edges\n of the pan where the eggs can easily overcook. \nTip:\n Only add the eggs if the cooking liquid is simmering, as with \nEgg Drop Soup\n. Also, try to add more egg whites at this stage, as the whites take longer to cook than the yolks. Ideally, we want to keep the yolks soft and runny for the final presentation.\n \nWhen the eggs are still runny but just set, add the rest of the eggs to the center and around the edges of the pan. Add the \nmitsuba\n (or green onion) on top and cook on medium low until the egg is done to your liking. Usually, oyakodon in Japan is served while the egg is almost set but still runny (raw eggs are safe to consume in Japan). \nTip:\n For the remaining one-third of the egg, try to distribute the egg yolk so the oyakodon will have a bright yellow color on top. For a good presentation, you can add a beaten extra yolk at the end.\n \nPortion \n2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice\n into individual \ndonburi\n or other serving bowls. Slide the cooked chicken and egg mixture onto the steamed rice and drizzle the desired amount of pan sauce on top.

The ultimate Christmas cookie, is it not??\n\n\n\n\nGingerbread Men\n\n\nIs it too early to get into Christmas baking? I think not. \n\n\nAnd is there any cookie more Christmas-y than Gingerbread Men? I KNOW not! Smells like Christmas, tastes like Christmas, looks like Christmas!\n\n\nYou’ll love these Gingerbread Men. You can actually really taste the ginger and spice flavour. They are lovely and moist inside, and you can make the dough \nmonths\n in advance – super handy to bake up fresh when the necessity arises!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you need for Gingerbread Men\n\n\nHere’s what you need to make these little Christmas Gingerbread Men!\n\n\n\n\nJust some notes on a few of the ingredients:\n\n\n\n\nMolasses\n – Essential for that deep, rich, caramel-like gingerbread flavour! It also helps hold the dough’s shape. Golden syrup makes a great sub, or treacle. Honey will also work, but the cookies will spread out a touch more and not have the same deep flavour (but still very, very good!). Maple syrup is no good, it’s too thin.\n\n\nBrown sugar\n – I’ve used ordinary brown sugar here. Light brown sugar results in a slightly lighter colour gingerbread and dark brown sugar can also be used which yields a richer, deeper brown colour. All are tasty!\n\n\nSoftened butter\n – If you want specifics: 17°C/63°F is ideal. It should be malleable but should not make your fingers shiny with grease when you poke it. Your finger should basically be clean. The texture is important: If it’s too soft, this will compromise your cookie dough!\n\n\nLarge egg\n – This is an egg that is 55-60g / 2oz, labelled as “large eggs” on the carton (it’s standardised). Make sure it’s at room temperature. Fridge cold eggs won’t blend in well (and also could cool the butter).\n\n\nSpices\n:\n\n\n\nGround ginger\n, of course. We are making GINGERbread men, after all!\n\n\nMixed Spice\n is a store bought blend of spices used holiday dishes that gives Gingerbread Men more layers of flavour. Using just ginger and cinnamon as many recipes do is just too one dimensional! Smells of Christmas, hails from Britain, common in Australia but if you can’t find it where you are, don’t worry – it’s easy to make up your own using standard spices: cinnamon, all spice, nutmeg, cloves, ginger and coriander (in recipe notes, and don’t worry if you’re missing one or two); and\n\n\nCloves\n are optional but add a nice hit of spice and warmth to the dough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to make Gingerbread Men\n\n\nGingerbread Men are made using a soft, generously-spiced cookie dough. It’s rolled out then a Gingerbread Men cookie cutter is used to cut the shapes out. Of course, it doesn’t have to be a Gingerbread Man – you can make any shape you want!\n\n\nMaking the Gingerbread Cookie Dough\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCream the butter and sugar, then add egg and vanilla. You can use a stand mixer or a handheld beater, as I have done;\n\n\nBeat in the molasses – it will change the colour to a deep golden brown colour;\n\n\nBeat in the dry ingredients in 4 equal batches. Adding them gradually helps them incorporate more easily; and \n\n\nThe dough will be soft and sticky – kind of like clay – and should stick together when you press it together.\n\n\n\n\nCutting Gingerbread Men Shapes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dough is quite soft and sticky so refrigerate it to firm it up. Do so for at least 2 hours, but you can leave it in the fridge for up to 5 days, or even freeze it for 3 months!\n\n\nCut the dough in half so you have one half to work with while you return the other half to the fridge to keep it cold.\n\n\nRoll the dough out between two sheets of baking paper / parchment paper;\n\n\nCut out Gingerbread Men shapes. My cutter is 11cm/4.5″ long. Press down firmly to cut all the way through so they lift out cleanly (though if you have scrappy edges, you can just tidy them up easily on the baking tray).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGingerbread Dough Rolling Tips\n\n\nGingerbread dough is quite soft and sticky which is what makes the cookies moist instead of dry inside. Refrigeration makes the dough easier to work with. At any point during the roll/cutting process, you can stop and refrigerate it to make it easier to work with (be sure to cover dough with cling wrap).\n\n\nRolling out between paper is easiest. \nTry to minimise use of dusting flour\n otherwise you will have white dust on the cooked gingerbread.\n\n\nWhen rolling, paper on underside tends to wrinkle as dough spreads out (which blemishes dough surface), so flip dough, peel off wrinkled paper then put it back on, smoothing out wrinkles.\n\n\n\n\nTransferring and Baking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeel off excess dough from around the Gingerbread Men;\n\n\nTransfer shapes to a baking tray using a palette knife or large kitchen knife. Something long and thin is best to minimise ruining the shape!\n\n\nPlace on a baking paper/parchment-lined tray, adjust the shapes and tidy up the edges if needed (I use a butter knife – just press on the scruffy edges to make them neat); and\n\n\nBake\n for 12 minutes for light golden and mostly soft (though slightly crisp on edges), or 14 minutes for deeper golden and crisp. The gingerbread men will be soft out of the oven but will firm up as they cool. Note however even crisp gingerbread men soften the next day. I’m yet to discover the secret to keep Gingerbread Men crispy (other than using a drier dough but that just makes dry Gingerbread Men!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrispy vs Soft?\n\n\nIf you want a softer cookie with the signature golden colour (pictured – my pick!), stick to 12 minutes bake time. For a crispy cookie with more colour, bake 14 minutes. For the latter, the cookies will be soft straight from the oven, but will harden upon cooling. Note however, even crispy cookies go soft the next day. They just won’t stay firm, sadly!\n\n\n\n\nThis recipe makes 20 Gingerbread Men using a cutter that’s 11cm / 4.5″ tall. I use 3 baking trays because the flow of this recipe works nicely to fill and bake one tray at a time.\n\n\n\n\nDecorating the Gingerbread Men\n\n\nThe best icing to use to decorating Gingerbread Men is \nRoyal Icing\n. It’s suitable for piping intricate designs which means it’s perfect for putting smiley faces on our Gingerbread Men, giving them decorative pants / skirts / shorts  and gluing on belly buttons etc.\n\n\nAlso, this icing sets hard and so won’t soften the Gingerbread Men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can get as fancy as you want with your decorations! The way I’ve piped the icing across the arms and waist in a zig-zag is a pretty classic way of decorating Gingerbread Men.\n\n\nI use mini M&M’s and silver balls for the buttons.\n\n\nAnd yes, I did give him a smiley face. Nobody wants to eat a grumpy Gingerbread Man! 😂 And even through this toughest of years we can all find some reason to smile, right?  \n– Nagi x\n\n\n\n\nWatch how to make it\n\n\nThis goes down as the cutest recipe video I’ve made all year!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHungry for more?\n Subscribe to my \nnewsletter\n and follow along on \nFacebook\n, \nPinterest\n and \nInstagram\n for all of the latest updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGingerbread Men\n\n\n\n\n Author: \nNagi\n\n\n Prep: \n30\n minutes\n \nmins\n\n\n Cook: \n40\n minutes\n \nmins\n\n\nDough chilling: \n2\n hours\n \nhrs\n\n\n\n\n \nChristmas, Cookies\n\n\n \nWestern\n\n\n\n\n4.71\n from \n41\n votes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Servings\n18\n \n– 20 gingerbread (depending on cutter size)\n\n\nTap or hover to scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Print\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3434\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipe video above. \nClassic gingerbread men! I love these because you can actually taste the spices. Smells like Christmas when they\'re baking!\nTOP TIP:\n The dough is quite sticky to work with (but sticky dough = moist cookie!). The trick is to make sure it\'s cold – so if it gets too sticky, return to refrigerator for a bit at anytime during roll out/cutting process.\n\n\nIngredients\nCups\nMetric\nDry Ingredients:\n▢ \n3\n \ncups\n \nflour\n \n, plain/all purpose\n▢ \n3\n \ntsp\n \nbaking powder\n▢ \n1\n \ntbsp\n \nground ginger\n▢ \n2\n \ntsp\n \nground cinnamon\n▢ \n1\n \ntsp\n \nmixed spice\n \n(Note 1)\n▢ \n1/4\n \ntsp\n \nground cloves\n \n(Note 2)\nWet Ingredients:\n▢ \n85g / 5 1/2 tbsp\n \nunsalted butter\n \n, softened (Note 3)\n▢ \n3/4\n \ncup\n \nbrown sugar\n \n(Note 4 re: light or dark brown)\n▢ \n1\n \nlarge egg\n \n, at room temperature (Note 5)\n▢ \n2\n \ntsp\n \nvanilla extract\n▢ \n1/2\n \ncup\n \nmolasses, light / true\n \n(NOT blackstrap)(Note 6)\n\n\nCook Mode\nPrevent screen from sleeping\n\n\nInstructions\nWhisk Dry\n Ingredients on one bowl.\nCream butter & sugar \n– In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar together using a stand mixer or electric beater on speed 7 for 2 minutes, or until light and fluffy.\nEgg & vanilla\n – Add the egg and vanilla, then mix on speed 5 until combined (~30 sec).\nMolasses \n– Add the molasses, mix for 1 minute using speed 2.\nGradually add dry ingredients\n – Add 1/4 of the Dry ingredients, then mix until you can\'t see flour (start on speed 1 to stop flour flying everywhere!). Repeat until all Dry ingredients are mixed in, then mix for further 15 seconds. Dough should be soft and a bit sticky – see video for texture.\nRefrigerate \n– Pat dough into a disc shape, wrap in the cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until firm. (Can refrigerate 5 days or freeze 3 months).\nPreheat \nthe oven to 375°F/190°C (170°C fan) and set a shelf in the middle. Line 3 x baking trays with parchment/baking paper.\nTake the dough out of the refrigerator and cut into half. Wrap half and return to the fridge.\nRoll out\n (Note 7)- Sprinkle a sheet of baking paper very lightly with flour. Place dough on top, sprinkle surface very lightly with flour. Place another sheet of baking paper on top. Roll dough out until 4mm / 1/6" thick using a rolling pin. As you work, flip and if paper is wrinkling, peel it off then put if back on, smoothing out wrinkles.\nCut out shapes\n (Note 8) – Use a gingerbread cookie cutter to cut out gingerbread men shapes, firmly pressing to cut all the way through. If the dough sticks to the cutter, dip it into flour.\nTransfer\n – Use a palette knife (or large knife) to transfer shapes onto baking sheet. Place 6 on the first sheet. Tidy edges if necessary using a butter knife.\nBake Tray 1\n – Bake for 12 minutes (for classic light golden) or 14 minutes (dark golden and crisp). Then remove and cool fully on tray.\nRepeat\n – Meanwhile, gather scraps of dough, press together then roll out again. If dough is sticky, return to refrigerator and work on the other half of the dough instead. Repeat rolling out and cutting out. You should have 18 to 20 gingerbread men in total (depending on cutter size)\nTrays 2 & 3\n – Fill and bake 2nd and 3rd tray with gingerbread men, 6 to 8 on each tray. I find the workflow that works best is baking one tray at a time ie. roll/cut-out/fill/bake one tray while you prepare the next.\nDecorate\n – Fully cool on trays, then decorate! Use a \nhalf batch\n of this \nRoyal Icing\n recipe to pipe and stick on decorations (sets hard and doesn\'t soak into cookies). The recipe makes more than you need, but it\'s impractical to make less. So freeze leftovers in fully sealed piping bag for future use.\n\n\n\n\n Recipe Notes:\nSpeeds are for handheld beater or stand mixer ranging from 1 to 10. Low = speed 2; Medium = speed 5; Medium-high = speed 7; High = speed 9 to 10.\n\n\n1. Mixed Spice\n is a store-bought blend of spices used in a lot of holiday dishes, and it gives Gingerbread Men that really amazing special Christmas touch. Smells of Christmas! Standard spice in the UK and Australia, but if you can’t find it, here’s how to make it:\n\n\n\n\n1/4 tsp each cinnamon and all spice\n\n\n1/8 tsp each nutmeg, cloves, ginger and coriander\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re missing one or two of the above, don’t fret, just skip it and replace with the same amount of ginger powder. So many spices going on in these cookies anyway, you won’t miss it!\xa0\n\n\n2. Cloves\n are optional but add a nice hit of spice and warmth to the dough.\n\n\n3. Softened butter\n – Technically 17C/63F. It should be malleable but should not make your fingers shiny with grease when you touch it. If it’s too soft, this will compromise your cookie dough results!\n\n\n4. Brown sugar\n – I’ve used ordinary brown sugar here. Light brown sugar results in a slightly lighter colour gingerbread and dark brown sugar can also be used which yields a richer, deeper brown colour.\n\n\n5. Large egg\n – This is a 55-60g / 2oz egg, labelled as “large eggs” on the carton. Make sure it’s at room temperature – fridge cold eggs won’t blend in well (and might cool the butter – not good).\n\n\n6. Molasses\n – Essential for that rich, caramel gingerbread flavour! Golden syrup makes a great sub, or treacle. Honey will also work, but cookie will spread a touch more, not be quite the same deep golden colour and not have the same rich flavour (still very, very good!).\n\n\nMaple syrup is too thin and will lose its flavour. Molasses sugar cannot be substituted either.\n\n\n7. Rolling tips\n – Gingerbread dough is quite soft and sticky, which is what makes the cookies moist instead of dry inside. Refrigeration makes the dough easier to work with. So at any point during roll/cutting process, you can stop and refrigerate to make it easier to work with (be sure to cover dough with cling wrap).\n\n\nRolling out between baking/parchment paper is easiest. \nDo not use too much flour\n otherwise you will have white dust on the cooked gingerbread.\n\n\nWhen rolling, paper on the underside wrinkles as dough spreads out (which blemishes dough surface), so flip dough, peel off wrinkled paper then put it back on, smoothing out wrinkles.\n\n\n8. Gingerbread man cutter\n I used is 11cm / 4.5″ long. My favourite shape which I only have is plastic which unfortunately doesn’t cut as well. Metal ones I’ve found may cut better but the shape isn’t as nice!\n\n\n9. Crunchy vs soft\n – If you want a softer cookie with the signature golden colour (pictured), stick to 12 minutes cook time. For a crunchier cookie with more colour, bake 14 minutes. The cookies will be soft straight from the oven, but will harden upon cooling. Note however, crispy cookies go soft the next day. They just won’t stay firm!\n\n\n10.\xa0\nDifferent measures in different countries\n – Tablespoon and cup sizes differ slightly from country to country. In most recipes, the difference is not enough to affect the outcome of the recipe, but for baking recipes, you do need to be more exact.\n\n\nThis cookie recipe as written works no matter what country you are in EXCEPT Japan (please use weights provided if you’re in Japan!). I’ve made it mixing up US and Australian cups (between which you see the greatest common size variance) and it came out the same. In fact, that is why the butter is 5.5 tbsp instead of 6 tbsp which 85g concisely converts to!\n\n\n11. Storage\n – These cookies last for 1 week in a tightly-sealed airtight container. \xa0Actually, I just ate one that was two weeks old and it was a bit dry but still delicious – no one would complain! The recommended icing for \nGingerbread Men\n will not soften cookies.\n\n\nDough\n – You can refrigerate the dough for up to 5 days or even freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in fridge then use per recipe.\n\n\n12.

Head \nhere\n to enter.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband has been asking me to make Dal Bhat (lentils and rice) and Tarkari (curried vegetables) for years. It\'s a dish he fell in love with when he lived in Nepal as a teenager.\n\n\n\nI delayed making Dal Bhat and Tarkari for three reasons:\n\n\n\n\nI\'ve never eaten it before so didn\'t know what it\'s supposed to taste like.\n\n\nPaul loves it so much, I was nervous about messing it up.\n\n\nIt\'s lentils, rice and vegetables. How could that possibly taste as good as Paul remembers?\n\n\n\nIn the end I bit the bullet and decided to make it for Paul for Valentine\'s Day.\n\n\n\nFortunately Paul had brought a copy of the \nINF\n cookbook, \nMade in Nepal\n, back from one of his more recent trips to Nepal and I was able to follow that to make the dish he loves so much.\n\n\n\nApparently Nepalese eat Dal Bhat and Tarkari twice a day, mid morning and early evening. You\'d think they would get sick of it, but after tasting it, I understand why they don\'t. It\'s \nso\n tasty and satisfying. Paul and I reckon we could happily eat it three times a week.\n\n\n\nThis recipe is vegetarian, dairy free, gluten free and super frugal.\n\n\n\n\nDal Bhat ingredients\n\n\n\n\n1c green/brown lentils\n\n\n2T oil (I use coconut oil as it has a high heat point)\n\n\n1 onion, diced\n\n\n3 cloves garlic, crushed\n\n\n2cm piece of ginger, crushed\n\n\n1/2t turmeric\n\n\n1/2t salt, according to taste\n\n\n4c liquid, eg. chicken stock, vegetable stock or water\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Bhat method\n\n1. Wash lentils and \nsoak for an hour\n or more.\n\n\n\n2. Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan and fry onion until golden brown.\n\n\n\n3. Add drained lentils, garlic, ginger, turmeric and salt and stir to combine.\n\n\n\n4. Pour liquid over lentils and cook over a medium-low heat until lentils are soft and the mixture is like a thick soup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Serve lentils over rice, or as its own soup.\n\n\n\n\nTarkari ingredients\n\n\n\n\n2T cooking oil (eg. coconut or ghee)\n\n\n1 onion, diced\n\n\n1/2t cumin powder\n\n\n1t coriander powder\n\n\n2 cloves garlic, crushed\n\n\n2cm piece ginger, crushed\n\n\n1/2t turmeric powder\n\n\npinch chilli powder\n\n\n1/4t pepper\n\n\n1/2t salt\n\n\n3 large potatoes, cubed\n\n\n3c chopped mixed vegetables, eg. cauliflower, green beans, aubergines, zucchinis, carrots\n\n\n3 tomatoes, quartered\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarkari method\n\n1. Heat oil in a heavy bottomed saucepan and fry onion until golden brown.\n\n\n\n2. Stir in cumin, coriander, garlic, ginger, turmeric, chilli powder, pepper and salt.\n\n\n\n3. Add potatoes, chopped vegetables of your choice and tomatoes.\n\n\n\n4. Turn vegetables over to coat with oil and spices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeans, zucchini, potatoes and tomatoes from my garden.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Cover and cook over low heat until all the vegetables are tender, turning gently from time to time.\n\n\n\n6. Serve with Dal Bhat and rice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Bhat and Tarkari on rice will serve 4-6, depending on your appetite.\n\n\n\n\nBudget breakdown\n\nOil - NZD$0.30\n\nVegetables - NZD$3.00\n\nRice - NZD$0.50\n\nLentils - NZD$0.50\n\nSpices - NZD$0.20\n\nChicken stock - FREE if you \nmake your own from scraps\n\nTOTAL - NZD$4.50 for a satisfying family-sized meal\n\n\n\nLooking for more gluten-free vegetarian meal inspiration?

My friend and his wife are both very good cooks and have taught me how to make dal bhat with curried vegetables, among other native dishes (roti, pickled vegetables, etc.). Last night, we had dal bhat with an asparagus curry -- quite delicious. I\'ve made dal many times, but ALWAYS with a pressure cooker. That\'s how it\'s made in Nepal. The orange-colored legumes make the best-tasting dal, IMO. Another tip I learned from the Nepalis is to blend the dal with a rotary hand beater after it has cooked, to give it a smoother consistency. These three things are a wonderful, satisfying taste combination. It\'s no wonder the Nepalis can eat it twice a day!\nReply\nDelete\nReplies\nReply\nAdd comment\nLoad more...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for visiting Craving Fresh, and for taking the time to comment.

Head \nhere\n to enter.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband has been asking me to make Dal Bhat (lentils and rice) and Tarkari (curried vegetables) for years. It\'s a dish he fell in love with when he lived in Nepal as a teenager.\n\n\n\nI delayed making Dal Bhat and Tarkari for three reasons:\n\n\n\n\nI\'ve never eaten it before so didn\'t know what it\'s supposed to taste like.\n\n\nPaul loves it so much, I was nervous about messing it up.\n\n\nIt\'s lentils, rice and vegetables. How could that possibly taste as good as Paul remembers?\n\n\n\nIn the end I bit the bullet and decided to make it for Paul for Valentine\'s Day.\n\n\n\nFortunately Paul had brought a copy of the \nINF\n cookbook, \nMade in Nepal\n, back from one of his more recent trips to Nepal and I was able to follow that to make the dish he loves so much.\n\n\n\nApparently Nepalese eat Dal Bhat and Tarkari twice a day, mid morning and early evening. You\'d think they would get sick of it, but after tasting it, I understand why they don\'t. It\'s \nso\n tasty and satisfying. Paul and I reckon we could happily eat it three times a week.\n\n\n\nThis recipe is vegetarian, dairy free, gluten free and super frugal.\n\n\n\n\nDal Bhat ingredients\n\n\n\n\n1c green/brown lentils\n\n\n2T oil (I use coconut oil as it has a high heat point)\n\n\n1 onion, diced\n\n\n3 cloves garlic, crushed\n\n\n2cm piece of ginger, crushed\n\n\n1/2t turmeric\n\n\n1/2t salt, according to taste\n\n\n4c liquid, eg. chicken stock, vegetable stock or water\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Bhat method\n\n1. Wash lentils and \nsoak for an hour\n or more.\n\n\n\n2. Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan and fry onion until golden brown.\n\n\n\n3. Add drained lentils, garlic, ginger, turmeric and salt and stir to combine.\n\n\n\n4. Pour liquid over lentils and cook over a medium-low heat until lentils are soft and the mixture is like a thick soup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Serve lentils over rice, or as its own soup.\n\n\n\n\nTarkari ingredients\n\n\n\n\n2T cooking oil (eg. coconut or ghee)\n\n\n1 onion, diced\n\n\n1/2t cumin powder\n\n\n1t coriander powder\n\n\n2 cloves garlic, crushed\n\n\n2cm piece ginger, crushed\n\n\n1/2t turmeric powder\n\n\npinch chilli powder\n\n\n1/4t pepper\n\n\n1/2t salt\n\n\n3 large potatoes, cubed\n\n\n3c chopped mixed vegetables, eg. cauliflower, green beans, aubergines, zucchinis, carrots\n\n\n3 tomatoes, quartered\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarkari method\n\n1. Heat oil in a heavy bottomed saucepan and fry onion until golden brown.\n\n\n\n2. Stir in cumin, coriander, garlic, ginger, turmeric, chilli powder, pepper and salt.\n\n\n\n3. Add potatoes, chopped vegetables of your choice and tomatoes.\n\n\n\n4. Turn vegetables over to coat with oil and spices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeans, zucchini, potatoes and tomatoes from my garden.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Cover and cook over low heat until all the vegetables are tender, turning gently from time to time.\n\n\n\n6. Serve with Dal Bhat and rice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Bhat and Tarkari on rice will serve 4-6, depending on your appetite.\n\n\n\n\nBudget breakdown\n\nOil - NZD$0.30\n\nVegetables - NZD$3.00\n\nRice - NZD$0.50\n\nLentils - NZD$0.50\n\nSpices - NZD$0.20\n\nChicken stock - FREE if you \nmake your own from scraps\n\nTOTAL - NZD$4.50 for a satisfying family-sized meal\n\n\n\nLooking for more gluten-free vegetarian meal inspiration?

I didn\'t fall in love with dal baht, but I did think it was pretty good for being so simple.  I\'ve been poking around the internet for recipes for awhile and this is the one I\'ve decided I\'ll try.

I had Bhat Tarkari at a restaurant yesterday and I want to make it at home. There was a spicy yogurt sauce on the side that was amazing too. Now I have to find that recipe ...\nReply\nDelete\nReplies\nReply\nAnonymous\nJanuary 15, 2013 at 12:46\u202fPM\nthanks for the recipe - just got back from nepal where i got hooked on dal baht. i\'ve never felt better energy, and overall feeling than on that diet. it truly felt like i was on steroids or something! since i was in a rural village with no refrigeration, everything was fresh and local. also i think the absence of wheat in the diet has something to do with it. \nReply\nDelete\nReplies\nReply\nMaria Dudley\nFebruary 11, 2013 at 10:11\u202fAM\nThanks for this recipe!!

I live alone and am on a tight budget so I made a double quantity of this and froze individual portions. It is delicious, even without the rice! (Sometimes I am mega lazy and I eat it like a soup). I could happily live on this. KJ in Western Australia.\nReply\nDelete\nReplies\nReply\nTheresa McG\nJuly 21, 2013 at 2:02\u202fPM\nThank you for the recipe. I lived in Kathmandu from 2004 to 2005 and I miss it terribly. I\'ve been craving Dal Bhat ever since I left, but (like you) I never had the guts to make it. I will try it now! \nReply\nDelete\nReplies\nReply\nAnonymous\nJuly 28, 2013 at 12:17\u202fPM\nI miss dal bhat!

I do an international night once a month where I cook a dish from around the world. This month I choose Napal. I plan on making your receipe. What\'s the estimated time for this dish to be prepared? I am trying to figure out if I need to make it on a weekend or if I could make it after work. \nI am excited to try it!! \nReply\nDelete\nReplies\nEmma\nNovember 20, 2013 at 10:51\u202fPM\nHi Nicole, thanks for your query. It does take a bit of time to prepare - maybe an hour or more - so you might want to save it for a weekend when you\'re tummy isn\'t rumbling at you while it cooks. Good luck!\nDelete\nReplies\nReply\nReply\nAnonymous\nDecember 7, 2014 at 4:08\u202fPM\nIs this recipe gluton free?\nReply\nDelete\nReplies\nReply\nMay\nNovember 14, 2015 at 8:53\u202fPM\nHi Emma, thank you for the recipe. We just got back from Nepal 3 days ago and my 6 yo daughter fell in love with dal bhat :))\nThis morning I was frying papad and she was asking for dal bhat for dinner tonight. Luckily I found the recipe in your website and now I can smell Nepali kitchen in house.\nThanks again Emma\nReply\nDelete\nReplies\nReply\nAnonymous\nNovember 20, 2015 at 9:38\u202fPM\nFinally I have been abled to replicate the dhal bat I love from my time in Nepal. Thank you for an excellent recipe! \nReply\nDelete\nReplies\nReply\nAnonymous\nApril 10, 2016 at 8:05\u202fAM\nI have close friends from Nepal who moved to the US several years ago. My friend and his wife are both very good cooks and have taught me how to make dal bhat with curried vegetables, among other native dishes (roti, pickled vegetables, etc.). Last night, we had dal bhat with an asparagus curry -- quite delicious. I\'ve made dal many times, but ALWAYS with a pressure cooker. That\'s how it\'s made in Nepal. The orange-colored legumes make the best-tasting dal, IMO. Another tip I learned from the Nepalis is to blend the dal with a rotary hand beater after it has cooked, to give it a smoother consistency. These three things are a wonderful, satisfying taste combination. It\'s no wonder the Nepalis can eat it twice a day!\nReply\nDelete\nReplies\nReply\nAdd comment\nLoad more...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for visiting Craving Fresh, and for taking the time to comment.
